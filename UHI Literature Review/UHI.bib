abstract = {An urban canopy layer model based on four energy balance equations at ground level and at building level was developed to simulate and describe the urban climate and the heat storage in an urban setting. Thermal and radiative characteristics of urban and rural surfaces as well as atmospheric parameters related to the general synoptic conditions were used as data input. In addition, buildings were modelled as parallelepipeds and the hysteresis of materials was taken into account. The model provides as output skin temperature of buildings, air temperature and humidity within the canopy layer and hence the mean surface temperature and the air temperature at 2 m above surface. The latter parameter was used for the comparison with in situ temperature observations. The model was applied to Rome in radiative summer and winter episodes. The results, which agree with observations, show that the Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a nocturnal phenomenon, present both in winter (the greatest difference between urban and rural temperatures is about 2 °C) and summer (the temperature difference is about 5 °C), mainly resulting from the urban geometry and the thermal properties of materials. The anthropogenic heat does not play an important role in the UHI development. A monthly nocturnal behaviour of temperature differences between urban and surrounding rural areas shows that the maximum mean value of 4.2 °C occurs in August. Moreover, the parks in the city centre, where temperatures are lower, define two distinct heat islands, east and west. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Open spaces in tropical climates are highly exposed to solar radiation. These conditions will influence the outdoor energy budget, leading to an increased heat island effect and reduced human thermal comfort. Trees, however, can influence the microclimate through radiation control that indirectly reduces direct radiation uptake and glare by humans and buildings. This condition affects building energy budget and human thermal comfort. This study compares the effectiveness of Mesua ferrea L. and Hura crepitans L. in shade creation and radiation modification in improving human thermal comfort. The study employed two methods: (i) a field measurement procedure and (ii) a computer-based sun-shading analysis using ECOTECT. The results from this study indicate that both M. ferrea L. and H. crepitans L. contribute significantly to direct thermal radiation modification below their canopies. The average solar filtration under the tree canopy for M. ferrea L. was 93{\%}, with 5{\%} canopy transmissivity, 6.1{\%} of leaf area index (LAI) and 35{\%} of shade area. For H. crepitans L. the average heat filtration under the canopy was 79{\%}, with transmissivity of 22{\%}, LAI of 1.5 and 52{\%} of shade area. Thus, the study found that M. ferrea L. was more significant as a thermal radiation filter than H. crepitans L., due to the former's denser foliage cover and branching habit. This significant filtration capability contributes to reduce more terrestrial radiation, cooling the ground surfaces by promoting more latent heat, reducing air temperature by promoting more evapotranspiration and effectively improves outdoor thermal comfort in tropical open spaces. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

This method is intended to produce data sets that are homogeneous for higher-order statistical properties, such as variance and the frequency of extremes, as well as for mean values.

abstract = {Records of the past years showed that the climate of built-up regions differs significantly from rural regions and one of the most obvious and important modifying effects of urbanization on local climate is the urban heat island (UHI). In this paper, four types of land cover, namely urban bare concrete cover, urban woods or the shade of trees, urban water areas and urban lawn, were selected to study their microclimate, and the UHI was also analyzed using air temperature data measured at four fixed observation spots in Nanjing, China, during hot weather from July to September, 2005. Dry and wet bulb temperature data were obtained by whirling psychrometers, and wind speed data by cup anemometers. Our observed data focused on the detailed statistical analysis of the microclimate variation in the four types of land cover during the whole day. The results showed that: (1) the microclimate of these four types of land cover had significant differences among different observation sites. In general, the air temperature of these four types of land cover complied with the order during daytime: bare concrete cover{\textgreater}lawn{\textgreater}water areas{\textgreater}woods or the shade of trees, with reversed order during nighttime when the air temperature of the lawn became the lowest. Compared with the bare concrete cover, the other three types of land cover showed the effect of dropping air temperature ranging between 0.2 and 2.9 °C. There were some instant dynamic characteristics in detailed temporal series among these four types of cover in the different observation sites. (2) The UHI effect could be detected obviously by the air temperature difference between the urban center area and the rural area. The average UHI intensity during the monitoring period was between 0.5 and 3.5 °C; however, there were also significant day-to-day variations. A strong UHI effect usually occurred around midnight; while about 2-3 h after sunrise the UHI began to decrease till midday time; and during 13:00-15:00, the UHI effect had a sudden increase and then decreased again; after sunset, a peak UHI effect was frequently observed during 18:00-21:00. (3) Finally, by means of the standard deviation (SD), this paper provides a concise and comprehensive understanding for the temporal and spatial microclimatic dynamics of these four kinds of urban cover in the four observation sites. Air temperature at the height of 1.5 m in Nanjing showed that the nocturnally horizontal temperature gradient was somewhat different from that reported in other large cities, and a marked heterogeneity in a smaller ground cover scale could be detected from the microclimatic spatial pattern. There is no doubt that the analysis of these four types of land cover presents the insight into possible countermeasures to decrease the high air temperature in hot summers, and is relevant to the urban planning redevelopment. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many studies have shown that air pollutants concentrations in coastal cities may be gravely affected by coastal recirculation. In this study an attempt is made to examine the properties of coastal recirculation over a long period (5 yrs) at multiple sites along the East Mediterranean Sea (EMS). For this purpose, a single station quantitative measure of horizontal recirculation is used based on wind field measurements over periods of 1–96 hrs. The horizontal recirculation is examined with respect to the integration time period, synoptic flow, seasonality, coastline variations, elevation, and air pollutants concentrations. The interaction between synoptic and mesoscales is shown to be a governing factor by allowing or overruling the land sea breeze winds. Favorite conditions for coastal recirculation are shown to be light or variable winds such as under a Cole or a High-Pressure system. The monthly distribution of the recirculation potential has a bimodal behavior with two peaks during the transitional seasons and October in particular. This is as a result of the annual cycle of night-time land-sea temperature difference driving the land breeze and the more frequent passage of synoptic scale flows with an easterly wind component at the EMS. Two factors leading to variations along the coastline are the urban heat island, weakening the breeze winds and reducing recirculation potential, and the concaved shape of the southern shoreline that causes a convergence and strengthening of the land breeze, thus supporting recirculation. The primary pollutants NOx and SO2 have the highest concentrations during weak daily mean wind speeds. O3 levels depict an almost opposite image of NOx, with higher values for both high and low recirculation, possibly resulting from either long range transport or coastal recirculation.},

abstract = {Minimizing energy consumption in buildings has become an important goal in architecture and urban planning in recent years. Guidelines were developed for each climatic zone aiming at increasing solar exposure for buildings in cold climates and at reducing solar exposure for buildings in hot climates. This approach usually plans for the season with the harshest weather; often forgetting that temperatures in cities at latitude 25° can drop below thermal comfort limits in winter and that temperatures in cities at latitude 48° often rise above thermal comfort limits in summer. This paper argues that a holistic approach to energy efficient building forms is needed. It demonstrates a generic energy efficient building form derived by cutting solar profiles in a conventional block. Results show that the proposed building form, the Residential Solar Block (RSB), can maximize solar energy falling on facades and minimize solar energy falling on roofs and on the ground surrounding buildings in an urban area in winter; thus maximizing the potential of passive utilization of solar energy. The RSB also supports strategies for mitigating the urban heat island through increased airflow between buildings, the promotion of marketable green roofs and the reduction of transportation energy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

This information is used to calculate local exchange coefficients for different city surface types (each with their own “local roughness” lengths); each surface's energy balances, including surface air temperatures, humidity, and wind, are then readily obtained. The model was run for several summer days in 2001 for the New York City five-county area. The most effective strategy to reduce the surface radiometric and 2-m surface air temperatures was to increase the albedo of the city (impervious) surfaces.

abstract = {A neighbourhood-scale multi-layer urban canopy model of shortwave and long-wave radiation exchange that explicitly includes the radiative effects of tall vegetation (trees) is presented. Tree foliage is permitted both between and above buildings, and mutual shading, emission and reflection between buildings and trees are included. The basic geometry is a two-dimensional canyon with leaf area density profiles and probabilistic variation of build-ing height. Furthermore, the model accounts for three-dimensional path lengths through the foliage. Ray tracing determines the receipt of direct shortwave irradiance by building and foliage elements. View factors for longwave and shortwave diffuse radiation exchange are computed once at the start of the simulation using a Monte Carlo ray tracing approach; for subsequent model timesteps, matrix inversion rapidly solves infinite reflections and inter-ception of emitted longwave between all elements. The model is designed to simulate any combination of shortwave and longwave radiation frequency bands, and to be portable to any neighbourhood-scale urban canopy geometry based on the urban canyon. Additionally, the model is sufficiently flexible to represent forest and forest-clearing scenarios. Model sensitivity tests demonstrate the model is robust and computationally feasible, and highlight the importance of vertical resolution to the performance of urban canopy radiation models. Full model evaluation is limited by the paucity of within-canyon radiation measurements in urban neighbourhoods with trees. Where appropriate model components are tested against analytic relations and results from an independent urban radiation transfer model. Further-more, system response tests demonstrate the ability of the model to realistically distribute shortwave radiation among urban elements as a function of built form, solar angle and tree foliage height, density and clumping. Separate modelling of photosynthetically-active and near-infrared shortwave bands is shown to be important in some cases.

abstract = {This study examines the spatial and quantitative influence of urban factors on the surface air temperature field of the medium-sized of Szeged, Hungary, using mobile measurements under different weather conditions in the periods of March 1999-February 2000 and April-October 2002. Efforts have been concentrated on the development of the urban heat island (UHI) in its peak development during the diurnal cycle. Tasks included: (1) determination of spatial distribution of mean maximum UHI intensity and some urban surface parameters (built- up and water surface ratios, sky view factor, building height) using the standard Kriging procedure, as well as (2) development of a statistical model in the so-called heating and non-heating seasons using the above mentioned parameters and their areal extensions. In both seasons the spatial distribution of the mean maximum UHI intensity, fields had a concentric shape with some local irregularities. The intensity reaches more than 2.1 degreesC (heating season) and 3.1 degreesC (non-heating season) in the centre of the city. For both seasons statistical model equations were determined by means of stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. As the measured and calculated mean maximum UHI intensity patterns show, there is a clear connection between the spatial distribution of the urban thermal excess and the examined land- use parameters, so these parameters play an important role in the evolution of the strong UHI intensity field. From the above mentioned parameters the sky-view factor and the building height were the most determining factors which are in line with the urban surface energy balance. Therefore in the future, using our model it will be possible to predict mean maximum UHI intensity in other cities, which have landuse features similar to Szeged.},

A neural network approach, based on predicted or recorded hourly values, is designed for modeling, predicting and estimating the air temperature at each station. Various feedforward, multiple layered, neural net-work architectures based on backpropagation algorithm are designed and trained for the stations' temperature prediction and estimation. The results were tested using extensive sets of measurements and it was found that they correspond well with the actual values. Furthermore, each one of the estimated stations is used as one input for the estimation of the next station's temperatures. The results were compared with the measured data and the neural network method was found able to simulate with sufficient accuracy the urban temperature field at several locations in a large urban region during the summer.},

abstract = {Residents wish to have outdoor spaces to enjoy walking, cycling, and other recreational activities, which are often hindered by the unfavorable thermal comfort conditions, especially in the summer. High building densities lower the average wind speed and this intensifies the urban heat island effects at city scale. The conscientious use of building morphology to create local thermal comfort zone at selected spots in a large precinct is becoming a pressing issue for sustainable urbanization. This paper is a proof of concept study via continuous monitoring of the pedestrian level winds and thermal parameters at two sample days in summer, which include instantaneous air temperature, globe temperature, wind speed and humidity. Three outdoor locations at an university campus are chosen and daytime thermal perceptions at the three sites were evaluated using PET (Physiological equivalent temperature). A PET based new index was defined, which is called the thermally-perceivable environmental parameter difference. By analyzing the simultaneous differences of radiant temperature, wind speed and air temperature between the monitored spots, it is shown that it was the wind speed and radiant temperature differences that were making significant differences in thermal comfort. This pilot study clearly indicates that wind amplification combined with shading effects can generate thermally comfortable conditions in the open ground floor beneath an elevated building, even on a sunny, hot summer day in a subtropical city. This finding helps to alert city planners of additional options available in precinct planning to encourage outdoor activities.},

abstract = {Reliable quantification of urban heat island (UHI) can contribute to the effective evaluation of potential heat risk. Traditional methods for the quantification of UHI intensity (UHII) using pairs-measurements are sensitive to the choice of stations or grids. In order to get rid of the limitation of urban/rural divisions, this paper proposes a new approach to quantify surface UHII (SUHII) using the relationship between MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and impervious surface areas (ISA). Given the footprint of LST measurement, the ISA was regionalized to include the information of neighborhood pixels using a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method. Considering the footprint improves the LST-ISA relationship. The LST shows highly positive correlation with the KDE regionalized ISA (ISAKDE). The linear functions of LST are well fitted by the ISAKDEin both annual and daily scales for the city of Berlin. The slope of the linear function represents the increase in LST from the natural surface in rural regions to the impervious surface in urban regions, and is defined as SUHII in this study. The calculated SUHII show high values in summer and during the day than in winter and at night. The new method is also verified using finer resolution Landset data, and the results further prove its reliability.},

abstract = {A new single-layer urban canopy model for use in mesoscale atmospheric models is developed and validated. The urban canopy model represents a built-up area as a street canyon, two facing buildings, and a road. In this model, the two facing walls are divided into sunlit and shaded walls on the basis of solar azimuth angle and canyon orientation, and individual surface temperature and energy budget are calculated for each wall. In addition, for better estimation of turbulent energy exchange within the canyon, a computational fluid dynamics model is employed to incorporate the effects of canyon aspect ratio (height-to-width ratio) and reference wind direction on canyon wind speed. The model contains the essential physical processes occurring in an urban canopy: absorption and reflection of shortwave and longwave radiation, exchanges of turbulent energy and water between surfaces (roof, two facing walls, and road) and adjacent air, and heat transfer by conduction through substrates. The developed urban canopy model is validated using datasets obtained at two urban sites: Marseille, France, and Basel, Switzerland. The model satisfactorily reproduces canyon air temperatures, surface temperatures, net radiation, sensible heat fluxes, latent heat fluxes, and storage heat fluxes for both sites. Extensive experiments are conducted to examine the sensitivities of the urban surface energy balance to meteorological factors and urban surface parameters. The reference wind speed is found to be a more crucial meteorological factor than the reference air temperature in altering urban surface energy balance, especially for weak winds. The urban surface energy balance is most sensitive to the roof albedo among urban surface parameters. The roof fraction, canyon aspect ratio, and ratio of roughness length for momentum to that for heat for the roof play important roles in altering urban surface energy balance.},

abstract = {Higher population density has altered the cities' old landscape with dense areas consisting of high-rise buildings. As a result, detrimental phenomena appeared inside modern cities that threatened the inhabitant's health and comfort. Among these phenomena, the Urban Heat Island (UHI) is known as the most harmful side effect of the urbanization which affects the Outdoor Air Quality (OAQ). In addition to the reduction of wind velocity within the urban canopies, the accumulated pollution decreases the OAQ and renders the pedestrian areas to hazardous level. According to earlier researches, the UHI generally shows more intensity in higher aspect ratio (the height of building to street breadth) canopies which mostly exist in high-density areas. These buildings' canopies have typically higher pollution concentration than low-rise residential building canopies due to lower air exchange rate and heavy traffic load. The situation becomes worst under the stable atmospheric stratification condition when the canopy ground is colder than the ambient air. Many passive strategies have been proposed to enhance the OAQ. However, the variety of the UHI makes the passive mitigation strategies ineffective in some cases. In this paper a novel approach, the pedestrian ventilation system (PVS), is proposed to ventilate building canopy under various atmospheric stability conditions: stable, neutral, and unstable. The capability of this system to enhance the pedestrian level health and comfort parameters (i.e. velocity, temperature and air exchange rate) has been studied using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. The results of the simulations confirm that the PVS can significantly improve the flow regime of the buildings' canopy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {AbstractThe Pearl River Delta region has experienced rapid urbanization and economic development during the past 20 years. To investigate the impacts of urbanization on regional climate, the Advanced Research core of the Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW-WRF) model is used to conduct a pair of 1-yr simulations with two different representations of urbanization. Results show that the reduction in vegetated and irrigated cropland due to urban expansion significantly modifies the near-surface temperature, humidity, wind speed, and regional precipitation, which are obtained based on the significance t test of the differences between two simulations with different urbanization representations at the 95{\%} level. Urbanization causes the mean 2-m temperature over urbanized areas to increase in all seasons (from spring to winter: 1.7° ± 0.7°C, 1.4° ± 0.3°C, 1.3° ± 0.3°, and 0.9° ± 0.4°C, respectively) and the urban diurnal temperature range decreases in three seasons and increases in one (from spring to winter: ?0.5° ± 0.3°C, +0.6° ± 0.3°C, ?0.4° ± 0.2°C, and ?0.8° ± 0.2°C, respectively). Urbanization reduces near-surface water vapor (1.5 g kg?1 in summer and 0.4 g kg?1 in winter), 10-m wind speed (37{\%} independent of season), and annual total precipitation days (approximately 6?14 days). However, the total rainfall amount increases by approximately 30{\%}, since the decrease in the number of days with light rain (8?12) is overcome by the increase in the number of days of heavy or extreme rain (3?6), suggesting that urbanization induces more heavy rain events over the urban areas. Overall, the effect of urbanization on regional climate in the Pearl River Delta is found to be significant and must be considered in any broader regional climate assessment.},

Surface and wind profiler observations are used to evaluate the performance of WRF-UCM. The model captures the observed nocturnal urban-heat-island intensity, diurnal rotation of surface winds, and the timing and vertical extent of sea breeze and its reversal in the boundary layer remarkably well. Using hourly SST slightly improves the WRF simulation of offshore wind and temperature. Model sensitivity tests demonstrate a delicate balance between the strength of sea breeze and prevailing offshore weak flow in determining the duration of the afternoon-evening stagnation in HG. When the morning offshore flow is weak (3–5 m s−1), variations (1°–3°C) in surface temperature caused by environmental conditions substantially modify the wind fields over HG. The existence of the city itself seems to favor stagnation. Extremely dry soils increase daytime surface temperature by about 2°C, produced more vigorous boundary layer and faster moving sea breeze, favoring stagnation during late afternoon. The simulation with dry soils produces a 3 h shorter duration stagnation in the afternoon and 4 h longer duration in the evening, which may lead to more severe nighttime air pollution. Hourly variations of SST in shallow water in the Galveston Bay substantially affect the low-level wind speed in HG.},

Moreover, the impact of the air conditioning (AC) systems on the air temperature, the relationships existing between energy consumption (EC) and meteorological conditions, and the evaluation of strategies to mitigate the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon can be evaluated using detailed UCP. In this work, a new UCP implemented in theWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (version V3.2) has been tested over the city of Madrid using two different turbulent parameterisations of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) under atmospheric conditions that were favourable for a large UHI. Two selected days were analysed coinciding with the Dual-use European Security IR Experiment (DESIREX) campaign that took place in the summer of 2008, and focused on Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Urban Thermography (UT) monitoring and assessment. For the two simulated days (30 June and 1 July) a high UHI intensity (5-6 °C) was observed and modelled. Numerical results for the surface air temperature and wind speed were compared against measurements showing a global satisfactory performance of the model. Some differences in the air temperature predictions were observed within the two turbulent schemes. Subsequently, the impact of the AC systems and the EC were evaluated for the simulated period. The heat fluxes coming from AC systems were responsible of an increase in the air temperature up to 1.5–2 °C in some dense urban areas. Effects of modifications in the roof albedo and building material properties reduced the total EC by 4.8 and 3.6{\%}, respectively, affecting the intensity of the UHI. When AC systems were not ejecting the heat fluxes out in the atmosphere, the EC was reduced to 2.5{\%}. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 Royal Meteorological Society KEY},

This is a preliminary study aimed at (1) devising a method to detect and compare the local cool-island intensities of various urban parks; (2) verifying that this local cool-island intensity differs among parks; (3) determining whether this local cool-island intensity is related to park characteristics. Results from air-temperature measurements in and around 61 Taipei city parks showed that urban parks were on average cooler than their surroundings, confirming the term "urban cool-islands." However, approximately one-fifth of the parks were warmer than their urban surroundings. At noon in summer, parks with ≥50{\%} paved coverage and little tree- and shrub-cover were on average warmer than their surroundings. Large parks were on average cooler than the smaller ones, but this relationship was non-linear. In Taipei, parks differed in their local cool-island intensity and this intensity can be related to park characteristics. Before further details concerning better planning and design approaches to mitigate urban heat-islands can be addressed, a neighborhood-scaled understanding of the urban microclimate is first needed as a basis. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The RC model represents the fundamental physical relations that govern the energy interactions between buildings and their urban environment, retaining the sensitivity to the design parameters typically used in building energy and urban climate studies. The benefits of the RC model are its simplicity and computational efficiency. It allows for better understanding the physics of the problem and makes it possible to easily evaluate modelling hypotheses and the sensitivity of different parameters. In this study, the RC model is evaluated against advanced simulation tools that are well accepted and evaluated within their individual scientific communities. The model is then used in a series of parametric analyses to investigate the impact of the Urban Heat Island effect on the energy consumption of buildings in configurations that are parameterized in terms of internal heat gains, construction, geometry, glazing ratio, and infiltration level. The RC model is also used to investigate the dominant mechanisms by which the indoor environment affects outdoor air temperatures. Parameters such as indoor air temperatures, exfiltration heat, and waste heat from HVAC systems are analysed. The conclusions obtained by this study can be applied to a wide range of urban configurations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

What is now beginning to be realised is that this approach can also help mitigate the impacts of global climate change (GCC) and provide assistance to city dwellers in adapting to the changes which have already occurred. By using case studies from around the world, this paper illustrates how vegetated SUDS devices can sequester and store carbon, cool urban areas and increase perceptions of health and well-being in the populace. Both vegetated and hard-engineered structures can evaporate water contained within them and are thus being used in cities to cool the overlying air. Also shown is the extent to which SUDS devices such as green roofs and wet pavements are being used to mitigate the urban heat island effect, which, while not caused by climate change, exacerbates its impacts. Of the houses needed by 2040 in the UK, 80{\%} already exist. In order to take advantage of the ability of SUDS to tackle some of the impacts of GCC, the emphasis must be placed on retrofitting technologies to existing buildings and this review proposes a simple hierarchy of suitable measures based on the density and land-use of the built-up area},

abstract = {Abstract Conventional impervious pavements have dark surface and large thermal inertia. During summertime they tend to absorb and store solar radiation but negate the evaporative cooling, contributing to the development of urban heat island (UHI). The idea of using cool pavements to mitigate the UHI has gained momentum recently. This review synthesizes the existing definition, physical mechanism, and typical cooling techniques of cool pavements, presenting the influence of cool pavements on the urban thermal environment. Benefits, penalties, costs and policies for the applications of cool pavements are presented with special emphasis on reflective pavements and evaporative pavements. The review suggests that the definition of cool pavements remain incomplete; that the influence of cool pavements on the air temperature in the urban canopy layer is unknown; and that the impact of cool pavements on the thermal conditions of adjacent buildings and pedestrians remains unknown. Many speculations of using cool pavements to battle the UHI effect need refinements and validations. Heat-harvesting pavements seem interesting because they not only stay cool but harness renewable energy. However, the results from the heat-harvesting pavement prototype require scrutiny on the power output, durability, and lifetime of the pavement system. Future studies are expected to understanding the impacts of cool pavements on pedestrian thermal stress, on adjacent building's energy loads, and on the air temperature in the urban canopy layer.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a comparative study aiming to investigate the effect of reflective coatings on lowering surface temperatures of buildings and other surfaces of the urban environment, and thus test their suitability to lower ambient temperatures and fight the heat island effect. In total, 14 types of reflective coatings, selected from the international market were studied, from August to October 2004, on a 24 h basis. These coatings are used in buildings and some of them are used or could be used in the future in other surfaces of the urban environment (sidewalks, parking lots, etc.). In order to investigate the thermal performance of the reflective coatings, surface temperature sensors and a data logging system as well as infrared thermography procedures were used. The spectral reflectance and the infrared emittance of the samples were also measured. The collected data have been extensively analyzed. It was demonstrated that the use of reflective coatings can reduce a white concrete tile's surface temperature under hot summer conditions by 4 °C and during the night by 2 °C. It can be warmer, than the ambient air by only 2 °C during the day and cooler than the ambient air by 5.9 °C during the night. "Cool" coatings present superior thermal performance even compared to other "cool" materials. This study can assist in choosing more appropriate coatings for building envelopes and other surfaces of the urban environment, and thus contribute to the mitigation of the heat island effect as well as the reduction of cooling loads and electricity consumption of buildings. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the last two decades, mesoscale models (MMs) with urban canopy parameterizations have been widely used to study urban boundary layer processes. Different studies show that such parameterizations are sensitive to the urban canopy parameters (UCPs) that define the urban morphology. At the same time, high-resolution UCP databases are becoming available for several cities. Studies are then needed to determine, for a specific application of an MM, the optimum degree of complexity of the urban canopy parameterizations and the resolution and details necessary in the UCP datasets. In this work, and in an attempt to answer the previous issues, four urban canopy schemes, with different degrees of complexity, have been used with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate the planetary boundary layer over the city of Houston, Texas, for two days in August 2000. For the UCP two approaches have been considered: one based on three urban classes derived from the National Land Cover Data of the U.S. Geological Survey and one based on the highly detailed National Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (NUDAPT) dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. Two-meter air temperature and surface wind speed have been used in the evaluation. The statistical analysis shows a tendency to overestimate the air temperatures by the simple bulk scheme and underestimate the air temperatures by the more detailed urban canopy parameterizations. Similarly, the bulk and single-layer schemes tend to overestimate the wind speed while the multilayer schemes underestimate it. The three-dimensional analysis of the meteorological fields revealed a possible impact (to be verified against measurements) of both the urban schemes and the UCP on cloud prediction. Moreover, the impact of air conditioning systems on the air temperature and their energy consumption has been evaluated with the most developed urban scheme for the two simulated days. During the night, this anthropogenic heat was responsible for an increase in the air temperature of up to 2°°C in the densest urban areas, and the estimated energy consumption was of the same magnitude as energy consumption obtained with different methods when the most detailed UCP database was used. On the basis of the results for the present case study, one can conclude that if the purpose of the simulation requires only an estimate of the 2-m temperature a simple bulk scheme is sufficient but if the purpose of the simulation is an evaluation of an urban heat island mitigation strategy or the evaluation of the energy consumption due to air conditioning at city scale, it is necessary to use a complex urban canopy scheme and a detailed UCP.

abstract = {Greening is a useful mitigation strategy for planners mainly from a visual perspective. For high-density urban living environment such as Hong Kong, urban greening helps cooling the air and providing shade; it also helps lowering building energy consumption by providing a better outdoor boundary condition. Many researchers have also suggested that greening may be employed as a strategy for combating the ill effects of urban Heat Island (UHI). Working towards a set of better greening guidelines for urban planners, the current paper first provides a comprehensive review of planning with urban greening. It then describes parametric studies that have been conducted to investigate the preferred location, amount, and types of vegetation for urban planning. The parametric studies employed the numerical model ENVI-met, verified using field measurements, to simulate 33 cases with different combinations of factors. For benefiting urban activities, ambient air temperatures at the pedestrian level are compared among different greening strategies and building heights. For a city such as Hong Kong, which has a high building-height-to-street-width (H/W) ratio, the present study reveals that roof greening is ineffective for human thermal comfort near the ground. Trees are also suggested to be more effective than grass surfaces in cooling pedestrian areas. The amount of tree planting needed to lower pedestrians level air temperature by around 1 °C is approximately 33{\%} of the urban area. The present study allows urban planners to identify more precisely the greening principles, amount and policies necessary for better urban living environment in high-density cities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {If a surface is under intense sunlight and open to warm air, cooling to below ambient has up to now been an elusive target. The technical goal is super-cool roofing with thermal perfor- mance well above that of existing cool roofs. Stringent spec- tral requirements at solar and infrared (IR) wavelengths are needed, leading to quite limited choices for suitable coating materials and layer structure. Metal alone, except silver, cannot provide the required level of solar reflectance of above 96{\%} and the thermal emittance of common metals is far too low to cool. Placing silver under a glass or polymer material with very low solar absorptance may cool well as high emittance Er results. However, options such as PMMA and most glasses absorb too much solar radiation. Low iron glass and various polyes- ters including PET absorb very little solar energy if thin, but their IR spectral response is not ideal for this task. Cooling is enhanced if IR spectral response in the thermal emission band involves a mix of moderate reflectance at those wavelengths where the atmosphere irradiates the earth under clear sky con- ditions and very high absorptance hence emission in the range from 7.9 $\mu$m {\textless} $\lambda$ {\textless} 14 $\mu$m, called the “sky window,” which is largely free of incoming radiation as it views the cold of space. Super-cool surfaces require solar reflectance and sky window absorptance to be close to 100{\%}. The admix of IR reflectance and absorptance in the down-welling atmospheric radiation band is less stringent but together with the sky window setting determines the value of overall thermal emittance Er which dic- tates the heat output rate at the roof temperature Tr. This radia- tive rate is an important practical consideration. Its final choice depends on total rate of heat input including the contribution of absorbed down-welling atmospheric radiation. We concluded that the desired combination of solar and IR criteria could be met using two or more specially chosen polyesters on a silver layer. At the set thickness, their IR absorptance had to be very strong in slightly different sections of the sky window with moderate transmittance at incoming wavelengths. A suitable surface was produced and set up outdoors. It remained subam- bient throughout a hot summer day including under the peak intense solar intensity of 1060 W m−2, with ambient at 27 °C, and high IR intensity from the atmosphere of 400 W m−2.},

abstract = {Many cities have inadequate green infrastructures and cannot benefit from ecosystem services brought by greenspaces. Global warming and urban heat island (UHI) effect impose a dual warming impact on cities, especially compact ones. Green roofs offer a plausible solution for climate adaptation. In compact humid-tropical Hong Kong, two green-roof and a control bare-roof plots were installed on a high-rise building. Precision sensors were installed along a holistic vertical temperature profile extending from outdoor air to roof surface, green-roof material layers, and indoor ceiling and air. Three apartments under the plots were kept vacant to monitor air-conditioning energy consumption. The comprehensive-systematic data allowed in-depth analysis of thermal performance of vegetation (Sedum and Perennial Peanut) and weather (sunny, cloudy and rainy) in summer. Intense solar radiation at Control plot triggered significant material heating, which in turn warmed near-ground air to intensify UHI effect and indoor space to lift energy consumption. Sedum plot with incomplete plant cover, sluggish transpiration and limited substrate moisture storage had feeble evapotranspiration cooling. The warmed roof passed heat to near-ground air and subsurface layers to impose a small indoor cooling load. Peanut plot with high transpiration rate can significantly cool foliage surface and near-ground air to ameliorate UHI. Its high moisture-holding capacity, however, can generate an appreciable heat-sink to push heat downwards and increase indoor cooling load. Practical hints on green roof design and management were distilled from the findings for application in Hong Kong and beyond and to contribute to climate-resilient cities.},

abstract = {A new method to detect errors or biases in screen-level air temperature records at standard climate stations is developed and applied. It differs from other methods by being able to detect microclimatic inhomogeneities in time series. Such effects, often quite subtle, are due to alterations in the immediate environment of the station such as changes of vegetation, development (buildings, paving), irrigation, cropping, and even in the maintenance of the site and its instruments. In essence, the technique recognizes two facts: differences of thermal microclimate are enhanced at night, and taking the ratio of the nocturnal cooling at a pair of neighboring stations nullifies thermal changes that occur at larger-than-microclimatic scales. Such ratios are shown to be relatively insensitive to weather conditions. After transforming the time series using Hurst rescaling, which identifies long-term persistence in geophysical phenomena, cooling ratio records show distinct discontinuities, which, when compared against detailed station metadata records, are found to correspond to even minor changes in the station environment. Effects detected by this method are shown to escape detection by current generally accepted techniques. The existence of these microclimatic effects are a source of uncertainty in long-term temperature records, which is in addition to those presently recognized such as local and mesoscale urban development, deforestation, and irrigation},

abstract = {Urban heat island{\&}{\#}8211;induced circulation and convection in three dimensions are investigated theoretically and numerically in the context of the response of a stably stratified uniform flow to specified low-level heating that represents an urban heat island. In a linear, theoretical part of the investigation, an analytic solution for the perturbation vertical velocity in a three-dimensional, time-dependent, hydrostatic, nonrotating, inviscid, Boussinesq airflow system is obtained. The solution reveals a typical internal gravity wave field, including low-level upward motion downwind of the heating center. Precipitation enhancement observed downwind of urban areas may be partly due to this downwind upward motion. The comparison of two- and three-dimensional flow fields indicates that the dispersion of gravity wave energy into an additional dimension results in a faster approach to a quasi-steady state and a weaker quasi-steady flow well above the concentrated heating region in three dimensions.In a nonlinear, numerical modeling part of the investigation, extensive dry and moist simulations using a nonhydrostatic, compressible model with advanced physical parameterizations {\&}{\#}91;Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS){\&}{\#}93; are performed. While the maximum perturbation vertical velocity in the linear internal gravity wave field exists in the downwind region close to the heating center, the maximum updraft in three-dimensional dry simulations propagates downwind and then becomes quasi stationary. In three-dimensional moist simulations, it is demonstrated that the downwind upward motion induced by an urban heat island can initiate moist convection and result in downwind precipitation. The cloud induced by the downwind upward motion grows rapidly to become deep convective clouds. Heavy rainfalls are localized in a region not far from the heating center by a convective precipitating system that is nearly stationary. The differences in results between two and three dimensions are explained by the presence of (moist) convergence in an additional dimension. The numerical simulation results indicate that the intensity and horizontal structure of the urban heat island affect those of circulation and convection and hence the distribution of surface precipitation.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method for predicting air temperatures within the Urban Heat Island at discreet locations based on input data from one meteorological station for the time the prediction is required and historic measured air temperatures within the city. It uses London as a case-study to describe the method and its applications. The prediction model is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling and it is termed the London Site Specific Air Temperature (LSSAT) predictor. The temporal and spatial validity of the model was tested using data measured 8. years later from the original dataset; it was found that site specific hourly air temperature prediction provides acceptable accuracy and improves considerably for average monthly values. It thus is a very reliable tool for use as part of the process of predicting heating and cooling loads for urban buildings. This is illustrated by the computation of Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Hours (CDH) for a West-East Transect within London. The described method could be used for any city for which historic hourly air temperatures are available for a number of locations; for example air pollution measuring sites, common in many cities, typically measure air temperature on an hourly basis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Nocturnal atmospheric cooling rates were investigated in a medium sized town in Sweden. Rates were found to be very different, depending on the time of the evening/night, therefore the urban heat island (UHI) development was divided into three phases: a, differential cooling; b, transition; and c, stabilization. In phase a the UHI intensity increases by differential cooling between urban and rural areas. In phase b, after the urban heat island circulation (UHIC) starts, there is a drastic change in the rural cooling rate. The urban cooling rate is unchanged in the early evening, but about 2 h after the start of the UHIC there is a sudden increase of the cooling rate as the cool rural air reaches the city centre. The UHIC is therefore assumed to be an effective way of transporting sensible heat between the rural and urban areas. In phase c this coupling results in an equalization of the cooling rates at both the rural and the urban site from 1.5 K h-1 and 1.0 K h-1, respectively, to 0.5 K h-1. Once the UHIC is activated, the system is self-regulating since if one factor is changed some of the others have to change as well in order to preserve the balance. In phase c the advective flux is estimated to be -9{\^{A}}4 W m-2 and to give a central UHI potential cooling of -0.3 K h-1.},

In this study, the authors used statistical analyses to study this association in the Taichung metropolis region. The air quality data obtained from government-owned observation stations and wind field profiles obtained from tethersonde monitoring (performed during 21-29 October 2004) were combined with the simulations of the horizontal wind fields at different heights by the air pollution model (TAPM). The results show that certain specific synoptic weather patterns worsen the air quality and induce the UHI phenomenon: Taichung's UHI appears clearly under the synoptic weather patterns featuring light air or breezes (0.56 m/s ≤ wind speed {\textless} 2.2 m/s) mainly from the north and west. Furthermore, under these weather patterns, the concentrations of air pollutants (NO2, CO2and CO) increase significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) with the UHI intensity. The convergence usually associated with nocturnal UHI causes the accumulation of O3precursors, as well as other air pollutants, thereby worsening the air quality at that time and also during the following daytime period.

abstract = {Daily, monthly and annual mean air temperatures in Guadalajara, Mexico, were gathered from the time periods: 1926-1994, 1957-1994, 1978-1994. The heat island effect was detected in a trend analysis of the series of minimum temperatures over the period 1926-1994. Also, it was found that the annual mean temperature increased 0.05 degreesC per year. A sharp increase has occurred over the last 20 years because of the abrupt expansion and industrialization of the city of Guadalajara. This study revealed the presence of a cool island in the centre of the metropolitan zone of Guadalajara (MZG) during the wet season. A cross-spectral analysis was used to study the thermal variations with different frequencies. Temperature oscillations in the MZG occurred in time intervals ranging from 3-5 days up to 22 years. The study suggests a relationship between urban growth and temperature variations. The temperature rise relates to urban growth with a correlation co-efficient equal to 0.857.

@article{Harger1995,
abstract = {The major features in development of the 'El Nino-Southern Oscillation' (ENSO) involve oscillation of the Pacific ocean-atmosphere in an essentially unpredictable (chaotic) fashion. The system moves between extremes of the so-called 'warm events' lasting one or two years and involving movement of warm sea water from the western Pacific along the equator to impact on the west coast of the American continent and 'cold-events' associated with easterly trade-wind-induced flows of colder water from the eastern Pacific towards the west. Historical data indicate that ENSO years as experienced by the Island of Java are either much warmer than non-ENSO years or only slightly, if at all, warmer than normal (non-ENSO) years. Hot-dry years within the ENSO warm event cycle are almost always followed by cooler wet years and vice versa. This pattern also extends to include the year immediately following the terminal year of an ENSO warm event set. The initial year of an ENSO warm event set may be either hot with a long dry season or relatively cool (nearer to the temperature of a non-ENSO year) and having a short dry season. In recent years, since 1950, of the 9 ENSO warm events, the initial year tends to have been hot and dry for 6 (1951, 1957, 1963, 1972, 1982, 1991) and neutral or cool and wet for 3 (1968, 1976, 1986). An area of 88,000 ha burned in 1991 (Jakarta Post 30 November 1991) largely in Kalimantan in association with the 1991-1992 ENSO event, an extensive pall of smoke developed over Kalimantan, Singapore and Malaysia during September-October of 1991. Surface vegetation-based fires continued to burn in East Kalimantan as of 29 April 1992 and extended into the 1992 dry season, in response to the ENSO conditions carrying forward from 1991. The increasing annual trend in air-temperature exhibited by the mean monthly values over the period 1866-1993, for the Jakarta and the Semarang data taken together is 1.64??C (0.0132??C per year from 25.771 to 27.409??C). The major industrial development in infrastructure for Jakarta has been significant only since 1980 or so and was not apparent before 1970 when the city had the aspect of an extended village with few large buildings (greater than 3-4 stories) and no extensive highways. The 1.65?? difference between 1866 and 1991 can presumably be partitioned into: (1) urban heat-island effect, (2) effect of deforestation, (3) effect of secular micro-climate shift, (4) influence of general global warming with particular reference to the tropics. When the blocks of non-ENSO years in themselves are considered, the deviations from the secular trend for warmest month mean temperatures in successive years are correlated with that of the next immediate year deviation so that either continual warming or cooling appears to take place from the termination of one ENSO to the initiation of the next. When the deviations around the secular trend shown by the warmest month average temperatures are summed for the inter-ENSO intervals (the separate non-ENSO years) the resultant 'heat-loading' index is positively correlated with the following (initial) ENSO warmest month deviation from the overall ENSO warmest month secular trend. This provides an immediate predictive mechanism for the likely strength of an ENSO, in terms of the dry season impact to the Island of Java, should one occur in the next year to break a non-ENSO sequence. The length of the build-up and the build-up achieved seems not to be related. The relationship does not in itself however, predict the occurrence of the 'next' ENSO. The data show that a consistent structure underlies ENSO events for the last century and a quarter. However, as a process monitored by mean monthly air-temperature measurements at Jakarta-Semarang, the system is changing in character with time in association with an overall atmospheric temperature increase in a way that involves increased intra-annual temperature fluctuations. In general ENSO years are associated with higher temperatures than non-ENSO years, with a significant negative correlation between subsequent years which are thereafter systematically cooler. This may be because the ENSO event actively mixes excess heat energy into the ocean-sink to an extent that is in direct proportion to the outstanding positive temperature deviation. A weak ENSO, preceded by a relatively modest temperature build-up in the lead-up non-ENSO years, then results in limited mixing which leads to a relatively warm subsequent year while a strong event leads to extensive mixing and so generally results in a following very much cooler year. Atmospheric temperature build-up possibly associated with the greenhouse effect may be coupled to an increasingly wider temperature swing in west and central Java associated with the warm pool influence but anchored by the ocean-sink.},

abstract = {An advance thermal video radiometer (TVR) was mounted onboard a helicopter and used to collect data over Tel-Aviv, Israel, from an altitude of 7000 feet. The sensor, sensitive to the 3-12 $\mu$m spectral region, consisted of an onboard calibration device and a 1{\textperiodcentered}8 mRad instantaneous field of view (IFOV), which enabled direct assessment of surface radiometric temperature patterns in very high spatial and thermal resolutions. The TVR capability was examined by studying the microscale structures of the urban heat island (UHI) of Tel-Aviv, Israel, during a stable calm night on 28 February 1995, The TVR data were found to be of high quality in terms of signal to noise ratio, reproducibility, stability, thermal sensitivity and spatial resolution capabilities. The radiometric data were analysed against air temperature acquired during the flight time by four mobile traverses that crossed the city from north to south. A significant heat island was identified over the inner city areas, which was found to be 5 °C warmer than the rural areas located 4 km to the south-east. Throughout the city, asphalt was found to be the major heat source whereas vegetation was found to be the most cooling element. A linear regression analysis between the air and radiometric temperatures showed that in general, good agreement exists between the two temperatures, Along the western routes (A and B) the correlation was relatively higher than that along the eastern routes (C and D) and was significantly different in the linear regression slope a. We assume that differences in atmospheric conditions, especially in the water vapour variation throughout the city, caused these inconsistencies. We concluded that the examined TVR is a very promising, low-cost remote sensing sensor, which can rapidly and quantitatively monitor the UHI in very high spatial and thermal resolutions from a high altitude. Based on these results we strongly recommend that the TVR be further examined in other remote sensing applications.},

abstract = {The urban heat island effect is recognized as a common and pervasive urban climatological phenomenon. Here the less common phenomenon of an urban heat sink is examined with respect to the mechanism which might explain its formation. Thematic Mapper (TM) data for a study area of central Indiana, including the Indianapolis metropolitan area, are employed in an effort to assess the heat sink in both qualitative and quantitative terms. The phenomenon is found to be regionally pervasive under specific conditions, and quite strong (6.4°C in our central Indiana case study). Explanations of the phenomenon are sought in the temporal and surface characteristics within the study area. A number of factors have contributed to the phenomenon: time and date of data acquisition, climatological conditions relating to soil moisture and air temperature, and agricultural land preparation relating to soil density. More specific understanding of the anomalous urban heat sink is sought through an examination of urban versus rural emissivity variations. Although it is an important variable, emissivity variation does not account for the magnitude of the heat sink gradient that we have observed. The anomaly within our study area and its magnitude can only be understood with reference to low thermal inertia (and consequent low conductivity) of the soil, which in turn are the result of specific observable conditions: dry, bare, and low density soil. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Remote sensing data from both Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 systems were utilized to assess urban area thermal characteristics in Tampa Bay watershed of west-central Florida, and the Las Vegas valley of southern Nevada. To quantitatively determine urban land use extents and development densities, sub-pixel impervious surface areas were mapped for both areas. The urban-rural boundaries and urban development densities were defined by selecting certain imperviousness threshold values and Landsat thermal bands were used to investigate urban surface thermal patterns. Analysis results suggest that urban surface thermal characteristics and patterns can be identified through qualitatively based urban land use and development density data. Results show the urban area of the Tampa Bay watershed has a daytime heating effect (heat-source), whereas the urban surface in Las Vegas has a daytime cooling effect (heat-sink). These thermal effects strongly correlated with urban development densities where higher percent imperviousness is usually associated with higher surface temperature. Using vegetation canopy coverage information, the spatial and temporal distributions of urban impervious surface and associated thermal characteristics are demonstrated to be very useful sources in quantifying urban land use, development intensity, and urban thermal patterns. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Air and ground surface temperatures measured at meteorological stations in large cities (population over 300,000) in South Korea were compared with in situ brightness temperature data. The correlation coefficient between air temperatures and brightness temperatures is 0.85 and the relationship may be expressed by the regression: AT=0.59 BT + 2.54. This equation explains 73{\%} of variances at the 0.02{\%} significance level. The best-fit line, however, underestimates air temperatures in such heat-processing industrial cities as Ulsan and Pohang, where smoke puffs up from the high stacks of industrial plants, and overestimates them in the Seoul metropolitan area. The regression equation of ground surface temperatures on brightness temperatures explains 72{\%} of variances. Assuming that optimal meteorological conditions can be selected, the regression equation can be used as a tool to assess air temperature fields in cities. Urban land-use, such as built-up, residential and industrial areas, was clearly identified from the AVHRR thermal data, while small-scale land-use, like parks, were not distinguishable. Brightness temperatures for the intensity of heat islands were related to the population size of cities. The areal magnitude of heat islands in the Seoul metropolitan area expanded considerably, reflecting the conurbation trend for the period 1986-1989. Urban temperatures in the area increased during the period, while temperature gradients declined. ?? 1993.},

The purpose of the AUSSSM TOOL is to determine quantitative parameters such as air temperature, exhaustive heat from air conditioning systems, energy heat balance, etc. within the urban canopy structure, which data enables the evaluation of effects of urban heat island (UHI) in concrete terms useful to urban planners, architects, engineers, and so forth in the field of urban climatology involving building scale. In addition to conducting a full numerical simulation, in order to simplify a comparison among complex factors influencing UHI, numerical experiments based on Taguchi design of experiment theory (DOE) were carried out. The results of the numerical experiments were stored in a database and ready to be instantly grasped by any inexperienced user corresponding to their specified conditions.

abstract = {This study examines and validates a technique for spatial enhancement of thermal satellite images for urban heat island analysis, using a nighttime ASTER satellite image. The technique, termed Emissivity Modulation, enhances the spatial resolution while simultaneously correcting the image derived temperatures for emissivity differences of earth surface materials. A classified image derived from a higher resolution visible wavelength sensor is combined with a lower resolution thermal image in the emissivity correction equation in a procedure derived from the Stephan Bolzmann law. This has the effect of simultaneously correcting the image-derived "Brightness Temperature" (Tb) to the true Kinetic Temperature (Ts), while enhancing the spatial resolution of the thermal data. Although the method has been used for studies of the urban heat island, it has not been validated by comparison with "in situ " derived surface or air temperatures, and researchers may be discouraged from its use due to the fact that it creates sharp boundaries in the image. The emissivity modulated image with 10 m pixel size was found to be highly correlated with 18 in situ surface and air temperature measurements and a low Mean Absolute Difference of 1 K was observed between image and in situ surface temperatures. Lower accuracies were obtained for the Ts and Tb images at 90 m resolution. The study demonstrates that the emissivity modulation method can increase accuracy in the computation of kinetic temperature, improve the relationship between image values and air temperature, and enable the observation of microscale temperature patterns. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the optimum cooling effect of trees with ground materials modification in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) and the benefits towards building energy performance in tropical climate. The modification focused on both physical properties - i.e. tree canopy density and quantity; and the albedo values of ground materials. Two phases of methodology were developed and applied using field measurement and computer simulation. This study measured the average monthly UHI intensity found to be +2.6 °C. In mitigating its impact, higher levels of tree canopy density (LAI 9.7) coupled with "cool" materials (albedo of 0.8) produced the largest urban air temperature reduction. Simulations predicted an average air temperature reduction of 2.7 °C when compared with the current condition. Further, both modifications were found to produce a potential building cooling load reduction of up to 29{\%}. In fact, the optimum improvement of both outdoor and indoor environment was influenced by three major physical factors, namely, larger tree quantity, higher canopy density and cool materials. Thus, it is suggested that appropriate guidelines, influencing implementation of these improvements could be implemented in order to mitigate the UHI effect in tropical climate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A parameterization for urban surfaces has been incorporated into the Community Land Model as part of the Community Climate System Model. The parameterization allows global simulation of the urban environment, in particular the temperature of cities and thus the urban heat island. Here, the results from climate simulations for the AR4 A2 emissions scenario are presented. Present-day annual mean urban air temperatures are up to 4 degrees C warmer than surrounding rural areas. Averaged over all urban areas resolved in the model, the heat island is 1.1 degrees C, which is 46{\%} of the simulated mid-century warming over global land due to greenhouse gases. Heat islands are generally largest at night as evidenced by a larger urban warming in minimum than maximum temperature, resulting in a smaller diurnal temperature range compared to rural areas. Spatial and seasonal variability in the heat island is caused by urban to rural contrasts in energy balance and the different responses of these surfaces to the seasonal cycle of climate. Under simulation constraints of no urban growth and identical urban/rural atmospheric forcing, the urban to rural contrast decreases slightly by the end of the century. This is primarily a different response of rural and urban areas to increased long-wave radiation from a warmer atmosphere. The larger storage capacity of urban areas buffers the increase in long-wave radiation such that urban night-time temperatures warm less than rural. Space heating and air conditioning processes add about 0.01 W m(-2) of heat distributed globally, which results in a small increase in the heat island. The significant differences between urban and rural surfaces demonstrated here imply that climate models need to account for urban surfaces to more realistically evaluate the impact of climate change on people in the environment where they live.

abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is considered as one of the major problems in the 21st century posed to human beings as a result of urbanization and industrialization of human civilization. The large amount of heat generated from urban structures, as they consume and re-radiate solar radiations, and from the anthropogenic heat sources are the main causes of UHI. The two heat sources increase the temperatures of an urban area as compared to its surroundings, which is known as Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII). The problem is even worse in cities or metropolises with large population and extensive economic activities. The estimated three billion people living in the urban areas in the world are directly exposed to the problem, which will be increased significantly in the near future. Due to the severity of the problem, vast research effort has been dedicated and a wide range of literature is available for the subject. The literature available in this area includes the latest research approaches, concepts, methodologies, latest investigation tools and mitigation measures. This study was carried out to review and summarize this research area through an investigation of the most important feature of UHI. It was concluded that the heat re-radiated by the urban structures plays the most important role which should be investigated in details to study urban heating especially the UHI. It was also concluded that the future research should be focused on design and planning parameters for reducing the effects of urban heat island and ultimately living in a better environment.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to evaluate the reliability of urban heat island intensity (UHII) as an indicator of urban heating. The diurnal patterns of air and surface-temperature based UHII and variations in urban and rural area heating were analyzed and discussed. The detailed air-temperature based UHII patterns were determined in one urban and four suburban areas of Hong Kong. UHII was determined as spatially-averaged air-temperature difference between an urban/suburban area and its surrounding rural area. Additionally, reported air and surface-temperature based UHII patterns were integrated in the discussion to carry out a comprehensive analysis. The urban and rural area heating variations (i.e., the diurnal variations in net radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and heat stored by an area) were examined in the light of UHII patterns to validate UHII as an indicator for urban heating. It is noted that the air-temperature based UHIIs were higher and positive in the night-time but lower and negative during the daytime. On the other hand, most of the surface-temperature based UHIIs, investigated through satellite data were positive during both the daytime and night-time. It is revealed that UHII can well reflect urban heating during night-time and early morning. However, the lower and negative UHII during solar peak time (daytime when solar radiation is the dominant source of heating) has seemingly not been representing urban heating. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The limited dataset collected during the test flight also provides useful insights into the impact of regional emissions and meteorology on aerosol vertical profiles. A total of five sampling test flights were conducted (each lasting for 1{\&}ndash;1.5{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}h) in the Pokhara Valley to characterize vertical profiles of aerosol properties such as aerosol number and size distribution (0.3{\&}ndash;2{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}µm), total particle concentration ({\textgreater}{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}14{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}nm), aerosol absorption (370{\&}ndash;950{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}nm), black carbon (BC), and meteorological variables. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} The vertical profiles of aerosol species showed decreasing concentrations with altitude (815 to 4500{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}a.s.l.); steep concentration gradient below 2000{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m (a.s.l.) in the morning and a more mixed profiles (up to ca. 4000{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}a.s.l.) in the afternoon. The strong gradient in the morning hours was mainly contributed by the primary emissions from the valley floor, including occasional open agriculture burning. The near-surface ({\textless}{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}1000{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}a.s.l.) BC concentrations observed in the Pokhara Valley were much lower than pre-monsoon BC concentrations in the Kathmandu Valley, and similar in range to Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) sites such as Kanpur in India. The sampling test flight also detected an elevated polluted aerosol layer (around 3000{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}a.s.l.) over the Pokhara Valley, which could be associated with the regional transport. The total aerosol and black carbon concentration in the polluted layer was comparable with the near-surface values ({\textless}{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}1000{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}a.s.l.). The elevated polluted layer was also characterized by high aerosol extinction co-efficient (at 550{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}nm) and was identified as smoke and a polluted dust layer. Long-term observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the Pokhara Valley (2010{\&}ndash;16) showed strong seasonality, with a pre-monsoon maximum which is also indicative of westerly advection transporting a mixture of dust and other aerosols from IGP into Himalayan foothills and mountain valleys. The observed shift in the westerlies (at 20{\&}ndash;30°{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}N) entering Nepal during the test flight period is an important factor for the presence of elevated polluted layers in the Pokhara Valley.

This synoptic-scale interaction is likely to drive the transport into the mountain valleys and higher Himalayas.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The intensification of an urban heat island, and its influence on the seasonal and annual air temperature measurements of the Prague-Klementinum station, is studied through a comparison with rural stations. Urban warming in the period from 1922 to 1995 was most conspicuous in winter and in spring (0.06°C 10yr-1), and the smallest and least significant in summer (0.01°C 10yr-1). Since the 1960s, a stagnation in the development of the urban heat island has appeared. The degree of urban warming prior to 1922 can only be roughly determined because of the lack of a suitable set of homogeneous reference stations.

abstract = {In a companion paper, the authors presented a formulation and evaluation of an urban parameterization designed to represent the urban energy balance in the Community Land Model. Here the robustness of the model is tested through sensitivity studies and the model's ability to simulate urban heat islands in different environments is evaluated. Findings show that heat storage and sensible heat flux are most sensitive to uncertainties in the input parameters within the atmospheric and surface conditions considered here. The sensitivity studies suggest that attention should be paid not only to characterizing accurately the structure of the urban area ( e. g., height-to-width ratio) but also to ensuring that the input data reflect the thermal admittance properties of each of the city surfaces. Simulations of the urban heat island show that the urban model is able to capture typical observed characteristics of urban climates qualitatively. In particular, the model produces a significant heat island that increases with height-to-width ratio. In urban areas, daily minimum temperatures increase more than daily maximum temperatures, resulting in a reduced diurnal temperature range relative to equivalent rural environments. The magnitude and timing of the heat island vary tremendously depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions and the characteristics of surrounding rural environments. The model also correctly increases the Bowen ratio and canopy air temperatures of urban systems as impervious fraction increases. In general, these findings are in agreement with those observed for real urban ecosystems. Thus, the model appears to be a useful tool for examining the nature of the urban climate within the framework of global climate models.},

abstract = {An important part of the world's energy is used for space cooling of buildings. Minimisation of space cooling, especially in hot urban environments, has great energy-saving potential. An important part of the heat exchange between buildings and the ambient surrounding is due to convective and radiative heat flows. The impact of these heat flows on energy consumption for cooling is much more important in urban areas compared to rural areas. This study aims at quantifying the influence of the urban radiation balance, the urban heat island effect and urban convective heat transfer coefficients (CHTC) on the space cooling demands. CHTC correlations were determined using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for different geometries including stand-alone buildings and street canyons of different lengths. Buoyancy was accounted for by considering differences between building surface and surrounding air temperature. It was found that the building geometry has a large impact on the CHTC correlations and that the effect of buoyancy cannot be neglected when wind speeds are low. These CHTC correlations were used for Building Energy Simulation (BES) predictions of the space cooling demand. Space cooling demands for a building in a street canyon differ up to a factor of 1.8 depending on the CHTC correlations used. Therefore, for accurate predictions of the space cooling demand, adequate CHTC correlations have to be used adjusted to the actual building configuration. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In order to contribute to the sustainability of the urban environment, knowledge about the urban climate should be translated into climatic guidelines for planning. However, there are hardly any studies on applied urban climatology in areas with a Mediterranean type of climate. The study presented in this paper has several aims: to identify the climatic needs in a coastal city with Mediterranean climate; to describe the methodology, which can be adapted in order to be used in other cities; to discuss some of the problems that arise when applying climatic knowledge to urban planning, including the selection of the adequate scale of analysis, the required data and tools, the selection of the planning priorities, and the need to develop a shared language among planners and climatologists; and last to contribute to furthering the debate on the advantages of including climatic guidelines in Master Plans of urban municipalities in a systematic way. Lisbon's case study is presented. As planners need spatialized guidelines, the mapping of Lisbon's physical features was carried out using a Geographical Information System. Based on a Digital Terrain Model and on data of urban roughness a "ventilation map" was produced. A "building-density" map was also prepared based on the analysis of a Landsat image and field work. By crosstabulating these two layers, a final map depicting Lisbon's "homogeneous climatic-response units" was prepared. Finally, a series of climatic guidelines for planning were put forth for the different units. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The day-by-day synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation in the lower troposphere for the same period was classified into eight statistically distinct categories. The neural network model employed as an input the corresponding synoptic categories in conjunction with four meteorological parameters that are closely related to the urban heat island. It was found that the synoptic-scale circulation is a predominant input parameter, affecting considerably the heat island intensity. Also, it was demonstrated that the high pressure ridge mostly favors the heat island phenomenon and categories characterized by intense northerly component winds are responsible for its nonappearance or termination.},

abstract = {The magnitude of the urban effect on temperature in the tropical city of Guadalajara is examined. Parallel to the city's growth, air temperature shows an increasing trend; over a 40-year period (1931-1970) this rate was of the order of 0.03°C yr-1. As would be expected, this rate of temperature increase has been uneven over the period. When population increase per decade was large (90{\%}), as in the 1940s the corresponding rate was significant (0.4°C per decade). The largest warming rate (0.7°C per decade) occurred during the 1960s when population growth was 73{\%}. These results suggest that other factors (on a regional/global scale) may have been at play. Results show that estimates of the intensity of the heat island in a tropical city are likely to be dependent (besides the physical factors implicit in the city size), on the land-use characteristics in the rural/suburban control. Since the suburban/rural substrates undergo a significant annual variation in their physical properties in Guadalajara, heat-island intensity is highest during the dry season and declining in the wet season when contrasts in urban/rural thermal admittance are likely to be minimal. The presence of lower temperatures in the city during the afternoon hours suggests that the city (especially in the dry season) acts as a moisture source. This "cool" island has also been observed in other cities with similar regional climate. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

To materialize the effects of spatial pattern of green cover on ULST, Landsat ETM+image data on May 5, 2002 was acquired to be processed for ULST estimation and to generate Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classes. Given to five percent of total available cells with a randomized distribution across the built-up areas, the linkage between ULST and composition, configuration and structure of green cover class was quantified. Five patch level landscape metrics including nearest distance (ND), patch area (AREA), perimeter to area (PARA), shape index (SHAPE) and core area index (CAI) were chosen and applied as explaining variables in statistical analyses due to their potential effects on ULST. Results of the present study have revealed that all the landscape metrics values of the green cover class were significantly correlated to their nearest ULST sample points, amongst which a stronger linkage was observed between ND (r=0.611, p {\textless}0.05) and ULST compared to others. Stepwise generalized additive modeling method-based multiple linear re- gression model was then fitted to dataset and resulted in developing the model (r2= 0.41, p {\textless}0.05), explaining the relationship between spatial pattern of green cover and ULST. Finally, we concluded that the present study could provide additional level of knowledge through which urban planners can optimize composition, configuration and structure of green cover patches to mitigate the adverse impacts of LST phenomenon especially where urbanization is still ongoing.},

abstract = {Due to rapid economic development, China has experienced one of the greatest rates of change in land use/land cover during the last two decades. This change is mainly urban expansion and cultivated land reduction in urban growth regions, both of which play an important role in regional climate change. In this paper, the variation of the urban heat island (UHI) caused by urbanization has been evaluated with an analysis of land use change in China. First, meteorological observation stations were grouped by different land cover types (dry land, paddy field, forest, grassland, water field, urban, rural inhabitable area, industrial and mineral land, and waste land) throughout China. These stations were subdivided into urban and non-urban classes. Then, a new method was proposed to determine the UHI intensity from the difference between the observed and the interpolated air temperature of urban type weather stations. The results indicate that the trends of UHI intensity in different land use change regions are spatially correlated with regional land use and its change pattern. During 1991-2000, the estimated UHI intensity has increased by 0.11 degrees C per decade in the spring and has fluctuated in other seasons throughout China resulting from land use change.},

abstract = {Understanding the causes of the intra-urban air temperature variability is a first step in improving urban landscape design to ameliorate urban thermal environment. Here we investigated the spatial and temporal variations of air temperature at a local scale in Beijing, and their relationships with three categories of landscape design parameters, including the land cover features, site geometry, and spatial location. Air temperature measurements were conducted during the winter of 2012 and the summer of 2013 by mobile traverses. The results showed that spatial temperature difference between the maximum and minimum observed temperature in the study area ranged from 1.2 to 7.0°C, and varied depending on season and time of the day. The magnitude and spatial characteristic of the air temperature variations depend strongly on the landscape parameters characterizing the immediate environment of the measurement sites. Increasing the percentage vegetation cover could significantly decrease air temperature, while the increase of building area would significantly increase it. In addition, the observed air temperature increased as the sky view factor (SVF) increased during daytime, while a contrary tendency was observed during nighttime. However, the impacts of SVF on air temperature were context-dependent. Furthermore, the air temperature increased with increasing distance from the park and water body boundary. Our findings also indicated that the relative importance of these landscape parameters in explaining air temperature differences varied among different times and seasons. Therefore, if appropriately combined, all investigated landscape parameters can effectively improve urban thermal environment on a yearly basis. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Results show that this region is undergoing rapid warming: the trends of annual mean minimum temperature (MMIT), mean temperature (MT), and mean maximum temperature (MMAT) are 0.40 C decade -1, 0.32 C decade -1, and 0.23 C decade -1, respectively. Regional average temperature series built with these networks including and excluding "typical urban stations" are compared for the periods of 1954-2005. Although impacts of UHIs on the absolute annual and seasonal temperature are identified, UHI contributions to the long-term trends are less than 10{\%} of the regional total warming during the period. The large warming trend during the period is due to a regime shift in around 1988, which accounted for about 51{\%} of the regional warming.},

abstract = {A new high-resolution dynamical downscaling strategy to examine how rural and urban areas respond to change in future climate, is presented. The regional climate simulations have been performed with a new version of the limited-area model of the ARPEGE-IFS system running at 4km resolution coupled with the Town Energy Balance (TEB) scheme. To downscale further the regional climate projections to a urban scale, at 1-km resolution, a stand-alone surface scheme is employed in offline mode. We performed downscaling simulations according to three model set-ups: (1) reference run, where TEB is not activated neither in 4km simulations nor in 1km urban simulation, (2) offline run, where TEB is activated only for 1km urban simulation and (3) inline run, where TEB is activated both for regional and urban simulations. The applicability of this method is demonstrated for Brussels Capital Region, Belgium. For present climate conditions, another set of simulations were performed using European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global reanalysis ERA40 data. Results from our simulations indicate that the reference and offline runs have comparable values of daytime and nocturnal urban heat island (UHI) and lower values than the inline run. The inline values are closer to observations. In the future climate, under and A1B emission scenario, the three downscaling methods project a decrease of daytime UHI between -0.24 and -0.20 degrees C, however, their responses are different for nocturnal UHI: (1) reference run values remains unaltered, (2) for the offline runs, the frequency of present climate weak nocturnal UHI decreases to the benefit of negative UHIs leading to a significant decrease in the nocturnal UHI over the city and (3) for the inline run, nocturnal UHIs stays always positive but the frequency of the strong UHI decreases significantly in the future by 1 degrees C. The physical explanation is put forth. Copyright (c) 2013 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {This paper examines the characteristics of the urban heat island (UHI) in a large Australian city (Melbourne) using local area weather data and the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses data of mean sea level pressure (MSLP). Conventional methods to determine the UHI from climatological data often involve comparing minimum temperature data between urban and rural environments. The findings presented in this paper show that comparing simultaneous measurements of temperature at one urban and three nearby airport sites at 0600 (Australian eastern standard time (EST)) provided a better estimate of the UHI magnitude. Analyses of these data between 1973-1991 were grouped according to the daily UHI magnitude. For each UHI group of the daily data, mean anomalous synoptic conditions from the 19-year mean monthly MSLP were examined for the influence of the different MSLP conditions on varying UHI magnitudes. These synoptic conditions included the entire range of weather conditions over the study period. Over the 19-year period, daily analyses of the regional climatological 0600 EST temperature data revealed a UHI between -3.16° and 6.0°C. The reanalyses of the NCEP MSLP data, in association with the local area climatological data, suggest that statistically significant anomalous anticyclonic conditions were associated with the warmest 17{\%} and coolest 1{\%} of UHI events. The position of the centre of the anticyclone was critical to UHI genesis and development. Statistically significant mean low pressure anomalies were associated with UHI values between 0° and 1°C. These occurred on 40{\%} of the days between 1973-1991. Melbourne's urban area, independent of the topography, was found to inhibit early morning advection events of warm continent air and result in an urban cool island (UCI).

abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI), together with summertime heat waves, foster's biophysical hazards such as heat stress, air pollution, and associated public health problems. Mitigation strategies such as increased vegetative cover and higher albedo surface materials have been proposed. Atlanta, Georgia, is often affected by extreme heat, and has recently been investigated to better understand its heat island and related weather modifications. The objectives of this research were to (1) characterize temporal variations in the magnitude of UHI around Metro Atlanta area, (2) identify climatological attributes of the UHI under extremely high temperature conditions during Atlanta's summer (June, July, and August) period, and (3) conduct theoretical numerical simulations to quantify the first-order effects of proposed mitigation strategies. Over the period 1984–2007, the climatological mean UHI magnitude for Atlanta-Athens and Athens-Monticello was 1.31 and 1.71°C, respectively. There were statistically significant minimum temperature trends of 0.70°C per decade at Athens and −1.79°C per decade at Monticello while Atlanta's minimum temperature remained unchanged. The largest (smallest) UHI magnitudes were in spring (summer) and may be coupled to cloud-radiative cycles. Heat waves in Atlanta occurred during 50{\%} of the years spanning 1984–2007 and were exclusively summertime phenomena. The mean number of heat wave events in Atlanta during a given heat wave year was 1.83. On average, Atlanta heat waves lasted 14.18 days, although there was quite a bit of variability (standard deviation of 9.89). The mean maximum temperature during Atlanta's heat waves was 35.85°C. The Atlanta-Athens UHI was not statistically larger during a heat wave although the Atlanta-Monticello UHI was. Model simulations captured daytime and nocturnal UHIs under heat wave conditions. Sensitivity results suggested that a 100{\%} increase in Atlanta's surface vegetation or a tripling of its albedo effectively reduced UHI surface temperature. However, from a mitigation and technological standpoint, there is low feasibility of tripling albedo in the foreseeable future. Increased vegetation seems to be a more likely choice for mitigating surface temperature.},

The process included field measurements of the thermal characteristics in the examined area, bioclimatic design and use of passive cooling techniques (cool materials, green spaces, water, solar control {\&} earth to air heat exchangers). Advanced simulation tools were used to evaluate and optimize the planed microclimatic modifications. CFD calculations with model PHOENICS have been applied for the simulation of the air flow and the temperature field at the concept design stage. The proposed design solutions included the increase of vegetation (planting of trees), the use of shading, as well as the use of cool materials with appropriate thermal and optical properties. In parallel, earth to air heat exchangers, are proposed to supply cool air during the summer period and preheat the ambient air during the winter. Simulations have shown that the use of the proposed bioclimatic measures can decrease the peak summer ambient temperatures up to 3 °C, while surface temperatures are decreased seriously. In parallel, the calculation of appropriate bioclimatic indices showed that the thermal comfort conditions were significantly improved with the application of interventions mainly because of the increase of shading as well as because of the use of construction materials with high emissivity and reflectivity values. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The percentage of urban population is projected to increase drastically. In 2030, 50.7 to 86.7{\%} of the total population in Africa and Northern America may live in urban areas, respectively. The effects of the attendant increases in urban land uses on biogeochemical C and N cycles are, however, largely unknown. Biogeochemical cycles in urban ecosystems are altered directly and indirectly by human activities. Direct effects include changes in the biological, chemical and physical soil properties and processes in urban soils. Indirect effects of urban environments on biogeochemical cycles may be attributed to the introductions of exotic plant and animal species and atmospheric deposition of pollutants. Urbanization may also affect the regional and global atmospheric climate by the urban heat island and pollution island effect. On the other hand, urban soils have the potential to store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) and, thus, contribute to mitigating increases in atmospheric CO2concentrations. However, the amount of SOC stored in urban soils is highly variable in space and time, and depends among others on soil parent material and land use. The SOC pool in 0.3-m depth may range between 16 and 232 Mg ha- 1, and between 15 and 285 Mg ha- 1in 1-m depth. Thus, depending on the soil replaced or disturbed, urban soils may have higher or lower SOC pools, but very little is known. This review provides an overview of the biogeochemical cycling of C and N in urban soils, with a focus on the effects of urban land use and management on soil organic matter (SOM). In view of the increase in atmospheric CO2and reactive N concentrations as a result of urbanization, urban land use planning must also include strategies to sequester C in soil, and also enhance the N sink in urban soils and vegetation. This will strengthen soil ecological functions such as retention of nutrients, hazardous compounds and water, and also improve urban ecosystem services by promoting soil fertility. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Green roofs have been increasingly enlisted to alleviate urban environmental problems associated with urban heat island effect and stormwater quantity and quality. Most studies focus on extensive green roofs, with inadequate assessment of the complex intensive type, subtropical region, and thermal insulation effect. This study examines the physical properties, biological processes, and thermal insulation performance of an intensive green roof through four seasons. An experimental woodland installed on a Hong Kong building rooftop was equipped with environmental sensors to monitor microclimatic and soil parameters. The excellent thermal performance of the intensive green roof is verified. Even though our site has a 100 cm thick soil to support tree growth, we found that a thin soil layer of 10 cm is sufficient to reduce heat penetration into building. Seasonal weather variations notably control transpiration and associated cooling effect. The tree canopy reduces solar radiation reaching the soil surface, but the trapped air increases air temperature near the soil surface. The substrate operates an effective heat sink to dampen temperature fluctuations. In winter, the subtropical green roof triggers notable heat loss from the substrate into the ambient air, and draws heat upwards from warmer indoor air to increase energy consumption to warm indoor air. This finding deviates from temperate latitude studies. The results offer hints to optimize the design and thermal performance of intensive green roofs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The proliferation of artificial container habitats in urban areas has benefitted urban adaptable mosquito species globally. In areas where mosquitoes transmit viruses and parasites, it can promote vector population productivity and fuel mosquitoborne disease outbreaks. In Britain, storage of water in garden water butts is increasing, potentially expanding mosquito larval habitats and influencing population dynamics and mosquito-human contact. Here we show that the community composition, abundance and phenology of mosquitoes breeding in experimental water butt containers were influenced by urbanisation. Mosquitoes in urban containers were less species-rich but present in significantly higher densities (100.4621.3) per container than those in rural containers (77.7615.1). Urban containers were dominated by Culex pipiens (a potential vector of West Nile Virus [WNV]) and appear to be increasingly exploited by Anopheles plumbeus (a human-biting potential WNV and malaria vector). Culex phenology was influenced by urban land use type, with peaks in larval abundances occurring earlier in urban than rural containers. Among other factors, this was associated with an urban heat island effect which raised urban air and water temperatures by 0.9uC and 1.2uC respectively. Further increases in domestic water storage, particularly in urban areas, in combination with climate changes will likely alter mosquito population dynamics in the UK},

abstract = {We have developed summary tables (sorted by heating- and cooling-degree-days) to estimate the potential of heat-island reduction (HIR) strategies (i.e., solar-reflective roofs, shade trees, reflective pavements, and urban vegetation) to reduce cooling-energy use in buildings. The tables provide estimates of savings for both direct effect (reducing heat gain through the building shell) and indirect effect (reducing the ambient air temperature). In this analysis, we considered three building types that offer the most savings potential: residences, offices, and retail stores. Each building type was characterized in detail by Pre-1980 (old) or 1980+(new) construction vintage and with natural gas or electricity as heating fuel. We defined prototypical-building characteristics for each building type and simulated the effects of HIR strategies on building cooling- and heating-energy use and peak power demand using the DOE-2.1E model and weather data for about 240 locations in the US. A statistical analysis of previously completed simulations for five cities was used to estimate the indirect savings. Our simulations included the effect of (1) solar-reflective roofing material on building (direct effect), (2) placement of deciduous shade trees near south and west walls of building (direct effect), and (3) ambient cooling achieved by urban reforestation and reflective building surfaces and pavements (indirect effect). Upon completion of estimating the direct and indirect energy savings for all the locations, we integrated the results in tables arranged by heating- and cooling-degree-days. We considered 15 bins for heating-degree-days, and 12 bins for cooling-degree-days. Energy use and savings are presented per 1000 ft2of roof area. In residences heated with gas and in climates with greater than 1000 cooling-degree-days, the annual electricity savings in Pre-1980 stock ranged from 650 to 1300 kWh/1000 ft2; for 1980+stock savings ranged 300-600 kWh/1000 ft2. For residences heated with electricity, the savings ranged from 350 to 1300 kWh/1000 ft2for Pre-1980 stock and 190-600 kWh/1000 ft2for 1980+stocks. In climates with less than 1000 cooling-degree-days, the electricity savings were not significantly higher than winter heating penalties. For gas-heated office buildings, simulations indicated electricity savings in the range of 1100-1500 kWh/1000 ft2and 360-700 kWh/1000 ft2, for Pre-1980 and 1980+stocks, respectively. For electrically heated office buildings, simulations indicated electricity savings in the range of 700-1400 kWh/1000ft2and 100-700 kWh/1000 ft2, for Pre-1980 and 1980+stocks, respectively. Similarly, for gas-heated retail store buildings, simulations indicated electricity savings in the range of 1300-1700 kWh/1000 ft2and 370-750 kWh/1000 ft2, for Pre-1980 and 1980+stocks, respectively. For electrically heated retail store buildings, simulations indicated electricity savings in the range of 1200-1700 kWh/1000 ft2and 250-750 kWh/1000 ft2, for Pre-1980 and 1980+stocks, respectively.},

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with locally applied vegetation in the street, i.e. avenue-trees, facade greening, roof greening and all three combined, were performed. The 3D steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were closed by the realizable k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model extended with source and sink terms to represent the effects of vegetation on air flow. By specifying a cooling power term in the energy equation, the transpirational cooling by vegetation was accounted for. The strongest cooling by a single vegetative measure was obtained with the avenue-trees with mean and maximum temperature reductions at pedestrian level of 0.43°C and 1.6°C, respectively. Facade greening resulted in rather small changes with mean and maximum reductions of 0.04°C and 0.3°C, respectively. For roof greening no noticeable reductions inside the canyon were found. In the case of a combination of all vegetative measures, cooling in terms of spatial distribution and intensity overall resembled a linear superposition of those of the vegetative measures solely applied with 0.52°C mean and 2.0°C maximum temperature reduction. Overall, the cooling was restricted to the vicinity of the vegetative measures, i.e. up to a distance of a few meters.},

abstract = {Urban heat island phenomena and air pollution become serious problems in weak wind regions such as behind buildings and within street canyons, where buoyancy effect cannot be neglected. In order to apply CFD techniques for estimation of ventilation and thermal and pollutant dispersion in urban areas, it is important to assess the performance of turbulence models adopted to simulate these phenomena. As the first step of this study, we carried out wind tunnel experiments and CFD simulations of gas and thermal dispersion behind a high-rise building in an unstable non-isothermal turbulent flow. The standard k-$\epsilon$ model and a two-equation heat-transfer model as RANS models, and LES, were used for the CFD simulation. One of the important purposes of this study was to clarify the effect of inflow turbulence (both velocity and temperature) on flow field and gas/thermal dispersion for the LES calculation. Thus, LES calculations with/without inflow turbulence were conducted. The inflow turbulence was generated through a separate precursor simulation. The calculated results showed that both RANS models overestimated the size of the recirculation region behind the building and underestimated the lateral dispersion of the gas. Turbulent flow structures of LES with and without inflow turbulence were completely different. The LES result with inflow turbulence achieved better agreement with the experiment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper describes the effects of the installation of various countermeasures against urban heat-island (UHI) and energy-saving measures on UHI and global warming. A UHI and energy-consumption simulation model was developed by combining the one-dimensional meteorological canopy and building energy use models; further, the proposed model was expanded to evaluate the year-round air temperature and annual energy consumption. The simulation results showed that the humidification and albedo increase at building-wall surfaces reduced the total number of hours for which the air temperature was more than 30 °C during the daytime by more than 60 (h) per year. The UHI countermeasures reduced the annual energy-consumption despite causing a small increase during the winter period. However, they may result in certain unfavorable conditions for pedestrians. Energy-saving measures, on the other hand, reduce the total number of hours for which the air temperature is more than 30 °C by only a few hours per year. Thus, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the UHI countermeasures and measures against global warming by extending the calculation period from summer to an entire year. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Children are routinely identified as a vulnerable population in environmental health risk assessments, experiencing adverse health outcomes due to exposure to a suite of atmospheric constituents. Objective: To provide a substantive overview of the research literature pertaining to biometeorological effects on children. Key information areas within urban environmental health research related to atmospheric variables (heat, air pollution, radiation) are assessed and integrated to better understand health outcomes and vulnerabilities in children. Critical avenues for improvement and understanding of children's health related to such biophysical parameters are also identified. Methods: This comprehensive review assesses past and current primary studies, organizational reports, educational books, and review articles. Emphasis is placed on the differential ambient exposures to temperature, air pollution, and radiation within urban microclimates commonly used by children (e.g., schoolyards, urban parks), and the resulting health impacts. Discussion: Exposure to heat, air pollution, and radiation are often enhanced in urban areas, specifically under the current design of the majority of outdoor child play places. Many heat indices, energy budget models, and health outcome studies fail to adequately parameterize children, yet those that do find enhanced vulnerability to ambient stressors, particularly heat and air pollution. Such environmental exposures relate strongly to behavior, activity, asthma, obesity, and overall child well-being. Current research indicates that a changing climate, growing urban population, and unsustainable design are projected to pose increasing complications. Conclusions: Evidence-based research to link children's health, physiology, and behavior to atmospheric extremes is an important future research avenue, underscoring the fact that children are among the population groups disproportionately affected by ambient extremes. However, current methods and population-based models lack child-specific inputs and outputs, as well as designated thresholds for accurate predictions of child health impacts. More substantive evidence is needed for applicable child-specific policies and guidelines.},

abstract = {The occurrence of protochlorophyllide b and protochlorophyllide b phytyl ester in green plants is described. The chemical structure of protochlorophyllide b phytyl ester was established by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopic analysis, and chemical derivatization coupled to electronic spectroscopic analysis. The macrocycles of protochlorophyll(ide) b are identical to those of conventional protochlorophyll(ide) except for the presence of a formyl group instead of a methyl group at position 3 of the macrocycles. They differ from chlorophyll(ide) b by the presence of an oxidized double bond at positions 7 and 8 of the macrocycles. The trivial name protochlorophyll(ide) b is proposed to differentiate these two tetrapyrroles from conventional protochlorophyll(ide), which in turn will be referred to as protochlorophyll(ide) a. Protochlorophyll(ide) b appears to be widely distributed in green plants. Its molar extinction coefficients in 80{\%} acetone and diethyl ether are reported. The impact of this discovery on the heterogeneity of the chlorophyll a and b biosynthetic pathways is discussed.},

abstract = {We hypothesize that city ventilation due to both thermally-driven mountain slope flows and building surface flows is important in removing ambient airborne pollutants in the high-rise dense city Hong Kong at no-wind conditions. Both spatial and temporal urban surface temperature profiles are an important boundary condition for studying city ventilation by thermal buoyancy. Field measurements were carried out to investigate the diurnal thermal behavior of urban surfaces (mountain slopes, and building exterior walls and roofs) in Hong Kong by using the infrared thermography. The maximum urban surface temperature was measured in the early noon hours (14:00-15:00 h) and the minimum temperature was observed just before sunrise (5:00 h). The vertical surface temperature of the building exterior wall was found to increase with height at daytime and the opposite occurred at nighttime. The solar radiation and the physical properties of the various urban surfaces were found to be important factors affecting the surface thermal behaviors. The temperature difference between the measured maximum and minimum surface temperatures of the four selected exterior walls can be at the highest of 16.7 °C in the early afternoon hours (15:00 h). Based on the measured surface temperatures, the ventilation rate due to thermal buoyancy-induced wall surface flows of buildings and mountain slope winds were estimated through an integral analysis of the natural convection flow over a flat surface. At no-wind conditions, the total air change rate by the building wall flows (2-4 ACH) was found to be 2-4 times greater than that by the slope flows due to mountain surface (1 ACH) due to larger building exterior surface areas and temperature differences with surrounding air. The results provide useful insights into the ventilation of a high-rise dense city at no-wind conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of electricity consumption to air temperature and air humidity are effective indicators in evaluating the impacts of countermeasures against urban heat islands. The impacts of these countermeasures vary in time and space and so sensitivities based on finer resolution data are needed. Using actual hourly electric power consumption data from the business districts of Tokyo, we calculated the sensitivity of electric power consumption using multiple regression analysis. The sensitivities appear from 07:00 to 23:00 local standard time (LST) during weekdays during both winter and summer, mainly from 09:00 to 17:00 LST. The sensitivities to air temperature during winter are approximately 0.7-1.1 (W/floor-m2)/°C on an average and those during summer are approximately 1.1-1.4 on an average; the sensitivities to air humidity are approximately 0.6-0.9 on an average. It was found that the sensitivities to air temperature are caused due to heating during winter and cooling during summer; further, the sensitivities to air humidity were caused by dehumidification not for conditioning the air humidity of the room but for the condensation around the air-conditioner's coils with cooling during summer. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Weexamined both long-term climate variability and anthropogenic contri- butions to current climate change for Xinjiang province of northwest China. Xinjiang encompasses several mountain ranges and inter-mountain basins and is comprised of a northern semiarid region and a more arid southern region. Climate over the last three centuries was reconstructed from tree rings and temperature series were calculated for the past 50 years using weather station data. Three major conclusions from these analyses are: (1) Although temperature varied considerably in Xinjiang over the last 200 years, it was non-directional until the last 50 yearswhen a substantial warming trend occurred; (2) The semiarid North Xinjiang was representative of the northern hemisphere climate, while the more arid South Xinjiang resembled the southern hemisphere climate, meanwhile, (3) The entire Xinjiang province captured the global-scale climate signal. We also compared human contributions to global change between North and South Xinjiang, including land cover/land use, population, and greenhouse gas production. For both regions, urban areas acted as heat islands; and large areas of grassland and forest were converted to barren land, especially in North Xinjiang. Additionally, North Xinjiang also showed larger increase in population and greenhouse gas emissions mainly associated with animal production than those in South Xinjiang.Although Xinjiang province is a geograph- ically coupled mountain–basin system, the two regions have distinct climate patterns and anthropogenic activities related to land cover conversion and greenhouse gas production.},

Second, geCAI predictions of mRNA levels were tested using differently coded GFP transgenes and were successful over a 25-fold range, similar to the variation in endogenous mRNAs. Third, translation was necessary for the accelerated mRNA turnover resulting from codon choice.

abstract = {Green roofs have been proposed for energy saving purposes in many countries with different climatic conditions. However, their cooling and heating potential strongly depends on the climate and building characteristics. In particular, the increase of the thermal capacity of green roofs compared to traditional roofs, if not controlled with insulation, may lead to higher cooling and heating loads. This paper discusses the energy saving potential of green roofs adopting a variable insulation strategy. A system consisting of a plenum located between a green roof and the room underneath and a sensor-operated fan that couples (or decouples) the green roof mass with the indoor environment was developed. The fan is activated and stopped using temperature based rules; the plenum is ventilated only when the fan works, creating a variable insulation system. Four cells with an insulated traditional roof, a non-insulated green roof, an insulated green roof, and a green roof with the variable insulation system have been tested in a hot and dry climate with mild winters over several years. This paper compares and discusses different plenum control algorithms. Results are particularly promising because the variable insulating system proved to adjust the thermal capacity of the roof effectively. In summer, the non-insulated green roof and the green roof with variable insulation system achieved the lowest indoor temperature; in winter, the insulated traditional roof and the variable insulation green roof system achieved the highest indoor temperatures. Measurements are hence compared with simulations. Finally, the energy saving potential of the new green roof system is evaluated. {\textcopyright}2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Increasing awareness of the urban heat island (UHI) effect has raised attention about the outdoor thermal comfort in cities worldwide. Several studies in the last decades have revealed how critical the UHI effect can be in a cold climate, such as in Canadian cities. As a result, in Toronto, one of the cities experiencing the highest rate of building development in developed countries, UHI mitigation strategies are currently the object of extensive debates. This study evaluates different UHI mitigation strategies in different urban neighbors of Toronto, selected according to their building density. The effects of cool surfaces (on the roofs, on the street pavements or as vegetation areas) are evaluated through numerical simulations using the software ENVI-met. Having obtained the surface temperature, outdoor air temperature, mean radiant temperature, and physiologically equivalent temperature, this study compares the possible mitigation of net surface radiation and thermal radiative power. The results demonstrate that the duration of direct sun and the mean radiant temperature, which are strongly influenced by the urban form, play a significant role in urban thermal comfort. Finally, this research supports new policies for promoting sustainable urban development in Toronto, and suggests design strategies for a more resilient urban planning.},

One urban site and one rural site have been instrumented with sodars, lidars and surface measurements. Additional radiosondes, 100 m masts and Eiffel Tower data were also collected. This paper gives a general overview of this experiment, and presents results of the analysis of four selected days, characterized by various wind directions and temperature inversion strengths. This analysis, which consists in a comparison between data obtained in the two sites, has been focused on three parameters of importance to the ABL dynamics: the standard deviation of vertical velocity, the surface sensible heat flux, and the boundary layer height. The vertical component of turbulence is shown to be enhanced by the urban area, the amplitude of this effect strongly depending on the meteorological situation. The sensible heat flux in Paris is generally found larger than in the rural suburbs. The most frequent differences range from 25-65 W m-2, corresponding to relative differences of 20-60{\%}. The difference of unstable boundary layer height between both sites are most of the time less than 100 m. However, sodar and temperature data show that the urban influence is enhanced during night-time and transitions between stable and unstable regimes.},

abstract = {This study compared different measures of urban heat island (UHI) intensity, which were calculated using both air temperature (Tair) at a height of 1.5 m and Landsat land surface temperature (LST) in Hangzhou, China. Two UHI-driven indicators (range and magnitude) and two land-cover-driven indicators (urban-rural and urban-agriculture) were calculated to quantify the UHI intensity based on hourly Tairfrom five stations and fifteen Landsat 5 LST images. Pearson correlation testing and a moving average times series of the previous 30 days were used to investigate the relationship between UHI intensities calculated by different indicators and data. The results indicate that the land-cover-driven indicators explain UHI better than the UHI-driven indicators, while the calculated values of UHI intensity using Landsat LST and hourly Tairare not comparable. We also investigated the influence of weather conditions on UHI intensity. Generally, Landsat-LST-based UHI performs best on hot sunny days, while Tair-based UHI has a better chance during the nighttime following a dry sunny day. This study suggests that the value of UHI intensity can be influenced by the selected indicators, the data used, the acquisition time and the weather conditions. Thus, these factors should be considered when comparing UHI intensity between different cities or quantifying their influences (e.g., population size, land use and land cover change) on UHI intensity.},

CCSM4 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations [Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5] are analyzed to examine how urban and rural areas might respond differently to changes in climate. The urban heat island (UHT), defined as the urban minus rural air temperature, is used as a metric. The average UHI at the end of the twenty-first century is similar to present day in RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, but decreases in RCP8.5. Both the daytime and nocturnal UHIs decrease in RCP8.5, but the decrease in the daytime UHI is larger and more uniform across regions and seasons than in the nocturnal UHI. This is caused by changes in evaporation that warm the rural surface more than the urban. There is significant spatial and seasonal variability in the response of the nocturnal UHI caused mainly by changes in the rural surface. In Europe, the response to climate change of rural leaf stem area in summer and clouds and rural soil moisture in winter explains the majority of this variability. Climate change increases the number of warm nights in urban areas substantially more than in rural areas. These results provide evidence that urban and rural areas respond differently to climate change. Thus, the unique aspects of the urban environment should be considered when making climate change projections, particularly since the global population is becoming increasingly urbanized.},

abstract = {The refurbishment of building roofs with cool selective coatings is already defined by some standards. Impacts on urban heat island (UHI) and thermal performance of buildings are well identified. In France, most of the developments on building thermal performances are focused on the building envelope insulation, especially for the winter energy performance, and the cool roof technique as a part of the solution for summer conditions is not well established. This passive technique for cooling the cities and indoor environments has a performance depending on the climatic location and constructions morphology. In this paper, we focus on a case study in Poitiers (France): a cool roof for a low-rise building (public housing), without any cooling active system. The performance of the cool coating is detailed through experimental results, completed by a dynamic simulation work on the studied building. In a first part, the case study is presented; the surface temperatures and the climatic conditions were monitored indoor and outdoor. Then, a dynamic simulation for the summer period is compared to the experimental results. This audit study of the actual case study permits the analysis extension of thermal condition in order to compare the performance of the envelope toward the cool roof.

abstract = {Elevated summertime temperatures in urban 'heat islands' increase cooling-energy use and accelerate the formation of urban smog. Except in the city's core areas, summer heat islands are created mainly by the lack of vegetation and by the high solar radiation absorptance by urban surfaces. Analysis of temperature trends for the last 100 years in several large U.S. cities indicate that, since ∼ 1940, temperatures in urban areas have increased by about 0.5-3.0°C. Typically, electricity demand in cities increases by 2-4{\%} for each 1°C increase in temperature. Hence, we estimate that 5-10{\%} of the current urban electricity demand is spent to cool buildings just to compensate for the increased 0.5-3.0°C in urban temperatures. Downtown Los Angeles (L.A.), for example, is now 2.5°C warmer than in 1920, leading to an increase in electricity demand of 1500 MW. In L.A., smoggy episodes are absent below about 21°C, but smog becomes unacceptable by 32°C. Because of the heat-island effects, a rise in temperature can have significant impacts. Urban trees and high-albedo surfaces can offset or reverse the heat-island effect. Mitigation of urban heat islands can potentially reduce national energy use in air conditioning by 20{\%} and save over {\$}10B per year in energy use and improvement in urban air quality. The albedo of a city may be increased at minimal cost if high-albedo surfaces are chosen to replace darker materials during routine maintenance of roots and roads. Incentive programs, product labeling, and standards cloud promote the use of high-albedo materials for buildings and roads. Similar incentive-based programs need to be developed for urban trees.

abstract = {People often suffer from the intense summer heat in Japan. This trend is increasing in urban areas because of the heat island effect and global warming. We evaluated the effect of pavements made of traditional and new materials on water and heat budgets. We expanded the NICE (NIES Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology) model to simulate the water and heat budgets for the various materials and to reproduce the cooling of water-holding pavement (consisting of porous asphalt and water-holding filler made of steel by-products based on a silica compound) by evaporation (NICE-URBAN); the results were compared with those from the simplified empirical model. NICE-URBAN simulated the cooling of water-holding pavement during the intense heat of summer in an urban area more correctly than the empirical model. Because the model estimates that the air temperature above the water-holding pavement is 1-2 °C lower than that above the lawn and 3-5 °C lower than that above the building rooftop, this material has a powerful positive cooling effect in combination with a lawn for a passive cooling effect. The simulation of NICE-URBAN showed that the surface temperature decrease in water-holding pavement is closely related to evaporation from the surface, the water volume of the pavement and the surface reflectance. The procedure used to integrate the model simulation with land use planning to effectively select and use ecosystem service sites is a very powerful approach to create thermally pleasing environments in a megalopolis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Intra-urban cooling rates were monitored for a year in the centre of G{\"{o}}teborg on the Swedish west coast. Five sites with different building geometry - from dense canyon to open space - within a radius of 300 m were analysed. Results showed two modes of cooling during the night. In the first mode, the cooling was site-dependent -the open space cooled the most and the dense canyon the least. In the second mode, which began about 3–4 hours after sunset, all sites cooled at the same rate. Our hypothesis is that in the early part of the evening both radiative divergence and sensible heat dominate the cooling. However, as the evening progresses, a spatially homogeneous inversion is established which controls the radiative cooling, making the cooling independent of both surface geometry and surface type. From April to November the sites cooled rapidly around sunset and the cooling slowly decreased during the rest of the night. However, between December and March, the cooling was less intense, with an almost constant rate during the entire night. It has been suggested that this might be the result of the draining of stored solar heat during the summer and a continuous flux of anthropogenic heating during the winter.},

This paper presents a Cost-Benefit Analysis of different vertical greening systems - green fa{\c{c}}ades and living wall systems - considering personal and social benefits and costs over their life cycle. Installation, maintenance, and disposal costs of each analysed system are compared with the related private and social benefits (increase of real estate value, savings for heating and air conditioning, cladding longevity, air quality improvement, etc.), determining three indicators: the Net Present Value (NPV), the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the Pay Back Period (PBP). The CBA demonstrated that some of the vertical greening systems analysed are economically sustainable. Economic incentives (tax reduction) could reduce personal initial cost allowing a wider diffusion of greening systems to reduce environmental issues in dense urban areas, such as urban heat island phenomenon and air pollution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We found that the heat island circulation developed less strongly than when using the at- mospheric model with the standard slab urban model. Additionally, the coupling with urban canopy model (i) delays the phase of surface air temperature, (ii) reduces the diurnal range of the temperature, and (iii) produces a nocturnal heat island, which results from the difference in atmospheric stability be- tween city and its surroundings. The features from the atmospheric model coupled with the canopy model agree well with those from observation, although the atmospheric model with the slab model does not. The simulated nocturnal heat island is caused by the larger heat storage of the canopy model which releases sensible heat after sunset.},

Most cities are not designed to ameliorate these effects although it is well-known that this is possible, especially through evidence-based climate-responsive design of urban open spaces. Urban parks and green spaces have the potential to provide thermally comfortable environments and help reduce vulnerability to heat stress. However, in order for them to provide this function, parks must be designed within the context of the prevailing climate and predicted future climates. To analyze the effects of elements that alter microclimate in parks, we used human energy budget simulations. We modelled the outdoor human energy budget in a range of warm to hot climate zones and interpreted the results in terms of thermal comfort and health vulnerability. Reduction of solar radiant input with trees had the greatest effect in all test cities. Reduction in air temperature was the second-most important component, and in some climates was nearly as important as incorporating shade. We then conducted similar modelling using predicted climates for the middle of the century, emphasizing the importance of city-level efforts for park design to assist in minimizing future climate-related urban health risks. These simulations suggested that heat waves in many climates will produce outdoor environments where people will be in extreme danger of heat stress, but that appropriately designed parks can reduce the threat.},

abstract = {Tremendous efforts have been devoted to improve our understanding of the anthropogenic effects on the atmospheric temperature change. In comparison, little has been done in the study of the human impacts on the subsurface thermal environment. The objective of this study is to analyze surface air temperature records and borehole subsurface temperature records for a better understanding of the urban heat island effects across the ground surface. The annual surface air temperature time series from six meteorological stations and six deep borehole temperature profiles of high qualities show that Osaka has been undergoing excess warming since late 19th century. The mean warming rate in Osaka surface air temperature is about 2.0 °C/100a over the period from 1883 to 2006, at least half of which can be attributed to the urban heat island effects. However, this surface air temperature warming is not as strong as the ground warming recorded in the subsurface temperature profiles. The surface temperature anomaly from the Osaka meteorological record can only account for part of the temperature anomaly recorded in the borehole temperature profiles. Surface air temperature is conventionally measured around 1.5 m above the ground; whereas borehole temperatures are measured from rocks in the subsurface. Heat conduction in the subsurface is much less efficient than the heat convection of the air above the ground surface. Therefore, the anthropogenic thermal impacts on the subsurface can be more persistent and profound than the impacts on the atmosphere. This study suggests that the surface air temperature records alone might underestimate the full extent of urban heat island effects on the subsurface environment. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We investigated the spatial and temporal variation in June mean minimum temperatures for weather stations in and around metropolitan Phoenix, USA, for the period 1990 to 2004. Temperature was related to synoptic conditions, location in urban development zones (DZs), and the pace of housing construction in a 1 km buffer around fixed-point temperature stations. June is typically clear and calm, and dominated by a dry, tropical air mass with little change in minimum temperature from day to day. However, a dry, moderate weather type accounted for a large portion of the inter-annual variability in mean monthly minimum temperature. Significant temperature variation was explained by surface effects captured by the type of urban DZ, which ranged from urban core and infill sites, to desert and agricultural fringe locations, to exurban. An overall spatial urban effect, derived from the June monthly mean minimum temperature, is in the order of 2 to 4 K. The cumulative housing build-up around weather sites in the region was significant and resulted in average increases of 1.4 K per 1000 home completions, with a standard error of 0.4 K. Overall, minimum temperatures were spatially and temporally accounted for by variations in weather type, type of urban DZ (higher in core and infill), and the number of home completions over the period. Results compare favorably with the magnitude of heating by residential development cited by researchers using differing methodologies in other urban areas.},

Nevertheless, district variations as regards the heat island intensity can be found in some regions, located close to the city centre and eastward of it, characterized by thick vegetation of trees or by "open areas". Moreover, in places near the sea the air temperatures are higher in the cold period of the year, not because of the urbanization but mainly due to the influence of the sea, which favors the maintenance of high air temperatures. Last but not least, the persistence of high air temperatures during the hot period of the year or low air temperatures in the cold period is mostly related to the synoptic weather conditions and it cannot reasonably be considered as an index for the heat island effect development.},

abstract = {Building energy computer simulation software is a useful tool for achieving sophisticated design and evaluation of the thermal performance of buildings. For successful thermal and energy simulation of buildings, it requires hourly weather data such as dry bulb air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, etc. Nowadays, an urban city faces a problem of an urban heat island which causes the urban area to have a higher air temperature than the rural region. Since the currently available weather dataset used in building simulation software mainly comes from weather stations located in remote and rural areas, the impact of the urban heat island on thermal and energy performance of buildings may not be effectively reflected. This paper reports an approach to construct a modified typical meteorological weather file, taking into account the urban heat island effect in the summer season. Field measurements have been carried out in the summer months and the corresponding urban heat island intensities were then determined. With a morphing algorithm, an existing typical meteorological year weather file was modified. An office building and a typical residential flat were modeled with a renowned building energy simulation program EnergyPlus. Computer simulations were conducted using the existing and modified typical meteorological year weather files. It was found that there was around a 10{\%} increase in air-conditioning demand caused by the urban heat island effect in both cases. The implications of this and further work will also be discussed in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The current Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Noah modeling framework considers only the dominant land cover type within each grid cell, which here is referred to as the “dominant” approach. In order to assess the impact of subgrid-scale variability in land cover composition, a mosaic/tiling approach (hereafter the “mosaic” approach) is implemented into the coupled WRF-Noah modeling system. In the mosaic approach, a certain number (N) of tiles, each representing a land cover category, is considered within each grid cell. WRF simulations of a clear sky day and a rainfall period over a heterogeneous urban/suburban setting show that the two approaches generate differences in the surface energy balance, land surface temperature, near-surface states, boundary layer growth, as well as rainfall distribution. Evaluation against a variety of observational data (including surface flux measurements, the MODIS land surface temperature product, and radar rainfall estimates) indicates that, compared to the dominant approach, the mosaic approach has a better performance. In addition, WRF-simulated results with the mosaic approach are less sensitive to the spatial resolution of the grid: Larger differences are observed in simulations of different resolutions with the dominant approach. The effect of increasing the number of tiles (N) on the WRF-simulated results is also examined. When N increases from 1 (i.e., the dominant approach) to 15, changes in the ground heat flux, sensible heat flux, surface temperature, and 2 m air temperature are more significant during nighttime. Changes in the 2 m specific humidity are more significant during daytime, and changes in the boundary layer height are most prominent during the morning and afternoon transitional periods.},

abstract = {Beijing has experienced rapid urbanization and associated urban heat island effects and air pollution. In this study, a contribution index was proposed to explore the effect of urbanization on land surface temperature (LST) using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived data with high temporal resolution. The analysis indicated that different zones and landscapes make diurnally and seasonally different contributions to the regional thermal environment. The differences in contributions by the three main functional zones resulted from differences in their landscape compositions. The roles of landscapes in this process varied diurnally and seasonally. Urban land was the most important contributor to increases in regional LSTs. The contributions of cropland and forest varied distinctly between daytime and nighttime owing to differences in their thermal inertias. Vegetation had a notable cooling effect as the normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI) increased during summer. However, when the NDVI reached a certain value, the nighttime LST shifted markedly in other seasons. The results suggest that urban design based on vegetation partitions would be effective for regulating the thermal environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The individual components of QFare calculated by using a combination of top-down and bottom-up modelling approaches of energy consumption applied to the local context. Results show that over a 24-h period, magnitudes of mean hourly QFreach maximum values of 113 W m-2in the commercial, 17 W m-2in the high-density public housing and 13 W m-2in the low-density residential areas, respectively. Buildings are found to be the major source of anthropogenic heat (primarily related to space cooling) in each study area, contributing to between 49-82{\%} of QFon weekdays and 46-81{\%} on weekends. The spatial and temporal variations of QFare attributed to differences in traffic volume, building energy consumption and population density.

abstract = {In this work, 45 years (1961-2005) of hourly meteorological data in Taiwan, including temperature, humidity, and precipitation, have been analyzed with emphasis on their diurnal asymmetries. A long-term decreasing trend for relative humidity (RH) is found, and the trend is significantly greater in the nighttime than in the daytime, apparently resulting from a greater warming at night. The warming at night in three large urban centers is large enough to impact the average temperature trend in Taiwan significantly between 1910 and 2005. There is a decrease in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) that is largest in major urban areas, and it becomes smaller but does not disappear in smaller cities and offshore islands. The nighttime reduction in RH is likely the main cause of a significant reduction of fog events over Taiwan. The smaller but consistent reductions in DTR and RH in the three off-coast islands suggests that, in addition to local land use changes, a regional-scale process such as the indirect effect of anthropogenic aerosols may also contribute to these trends. A reduction in light precipitation ({\textless}4 mm h(-1)) and an increase in heavy precipitation ({\textgreater}10 mm h(-1)) are found over Taiwan and the offshore islands. The changes in precipitation are similar to the changes of other areas in Asia, but they are different from those of the United States, Europe, and the tropical oceans. The latter do not show any reduction in light precipitation.},

abstract = {Monitoring of (surface) urban heat islands (UHI) is possible through satellite remote sensing of the land surface temperature (LST). Previous UHI studies are based on medium and high spatial resolution images, which are in the best-case scenario available about four times per day. This is not adequate for monitoring diurnal UHI development. High temporal resolution LST data (a few measurements per hour) over a whole city can be acquired by instruments onboard geostationary satellites. In northern Germany, geostationary LST data are available in pixels sized 3,300 by 6,700 m. For UHI monitoring, this resolution is too coarse, it should be comparable instead to the width of a building block: usually not more than 100 m. Thus, an LST downscaling is proposed that enhances the spatial resolution by a factor of about 2,000, which is much higher than in any previous study. The case study presented here (Hamburg, Germany) yields promising results. The latter, available every 15 min in 100 m spatial resolution, showed a high explained variance (R-2: 0.71) and a relatively low root mean square error (RMSE: 2.2 K). For lower resolutions the downscaling scheme performs even better (R-2: 0.80, RMSE: 1.8 K for 500 m; R-2: 0.82, RMSE: 1.6 K for 1,000 m).},

abstract = {Temporal aspects of the urban heat island (UHI) of Vancouver, British Columbia, are demonstrated using differences of screen-level air temperature observed at an urban (downtown) and rural (farmland) site for three years. On an annual basis, the UHI is at its maximum near the middle of the night and its minimum is in mid-afternoon. Growth of the nocturnal UHI is driven by rural cooling rates in the early evening, which are much greater than the almost constant rates in the city. Growth starts earlier in winter. The largest UHI occurs in the fall, and the smallest in the spring. In daytime there is often a "cool island," especially in summer. There is an approximately inverse square root control of the UHI by wind speed and the effect of cloud type and amount follows the Bolt relation. Combining the two gives a "weather factor" that is linearly related to maximum UHI magnitude. Seasonal variation of the UHI is shown to be inversely related to the thermal admittance of the rural site, which itself is controlled largely by soil moisture status. This is done by calculating a "potential" UHI that is free of weather effects; a value that approximately conforms to that predicted by the SHIM numerical model. Surface wetting caused by recent rain, fog, or melting snow also is found to reduce UHI magnitude. While not quantified, marine advective effects appear to modify the UHI, especially the summer daytime cool island.},

Here, we explore its land-use and land-cover changes, focusing on the impacts of the urbanization process on air and water quality, local climate, and biodiversity. Over the past 30 years, Shanghai's urban area and green land (eg urban parks, street trees, lawns) have increased dramatically, at the expense of cropland. Concentrations of major air pollutants (eg SO(2), NO(x), and total suspended particles) were higher in urban areas than in suburban and rural areas. Overall, however, concentrations have decreased (with the exception of NO(x)), due primarily to a decline in coal consumption by industry and in private households. Increased NOx pollution was mainly attributed to the huge increase in the number of vehicles on the roads. Water quality changes showed a pattern similar to that of air quality, with the most severe pollution occurring in urban areas. Differences in mean air temperatures between urban and rural areas also increased, in line with the rapid pace of urban expansion, indicating an accelerating "urban heat island" effect. Urban expansion also led to a decrease in native plant species. Despite its severe environmental problems, Shanghai has also seen major economic development. Managing the tradeoffs between urbanization and environmental protection will be a major challenge for Chinese policy makers.},

The results revealed a complex urban-rural environmental gradient. The urban forests exhibit unique ecosystem structure and function in relation to the suburban and rural forest stands; these are likely linked to stresses of the urban environment such as air pollution, which has also resulted in elevated levels of heavy metals in the soil, the positive effects of the heat island phenomenon, and the presence of earthworms.

abstract = {This study examines the connection between the built-up urban surface and near-surface air temperature. The studied city (Szeged, Hungary) is located on a low and flat flood plain with a population of 160,000. Data were collected by mobile measurements under different weather conditions between March 1999 and February 2000. The efforts have been focussed on investigating the maximum development of the urban heat island (UHI) along an urban cross-section. According to the results, the UHI intensity changed according to season and month, as a consequence of the prevailing weather conditions. The role of cloudiness and wind speed on the temporal variation of the largest UHI, which represents the increasing effect of Szeged on temperature, is clearly recognized during most of the time in the studied period. The seasonal profiles follow remarkably well the general cross-section of the typical UHI described by Oke (Oke, T.R., 1987. Boundary Layer Climates. Routledge, London) who defines its characteristic parts as 'cliff', 'plateau' and 'peak'. The usefulness of the normalized values in the investigation is proved, the form of the seasonal mean UHI profile is independent of the seasonal climatological conditions, and is determined to a high degree by urban surface factors. As a conclusion, we suggest a modified model describing the metropolitan temperature variable for cities situated in simple geographical conditions: it is equal to the sum of components of the basic climate of the region and of the production of urbanization at the surface, where this last term is a multiplication of weather and urban surface factors.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior studies from around the world have indicated that very high temperatures tend to increase summertime mortality. However possible effect modification by urban micro heat islands has only been examined by a few studies in North America and Europe. This study examined whether daily mortality in micro heat island areas of Hong Kong was more sensitive to short term changes in meteorological conditions than in other areas. METHOD: An urban heat island index (UHII) was calculated for each of Hong Kong's 248 geographical tertiary planning units (TPU). Daily counts of all natural deaths among Hong Kong residents were stratified according to whether the place of residence of the decedent was in a TPU with high (above the median) or low UHII. Poisson Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were used to estimate the association between meteorological variables and mortality while adjusting for trend, seasonality, pollutants and flu epidemics. Analyses were restricted to the hot season (June-September). RESULTS: Mean temperatures (lags 0-4) above 29 °C and low mean wind speeds (lags 0-4) were significantly associated with higher daily mortality and these associations were stronger in areas with high UHII. A 1 °C rise above 29 °C was associated with a 4.1{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.7{\%}, 7.6{\%}) increase in natural mortality in areas with high UHII but only a 0.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: -2.4{\%}, 3.9{\%}) increase in low UHII areas. Lower mean wind speeds (5(th) percentile vs. 95(th) percentile) were associated with a 5.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.7, 8.9) mortality increase in high UHII areas vs. a -0.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: -3.2{\%}, 2.6{\%}) change in low UHII areas. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that urban micro heat islands exacerbate the negative health consequences of high temperatures and low wind speeds. Urban planning measures designed to mitigate heat island effects may lessen the health effects of unfavorable summertime meteorological conditions.},

abstract = {Urban open spaces such as parks can act as urban cool islands. For example, in Seoul, Korea, the many Lee Dynasty royal palaces and tombs act as urban cool islands that reduce the temperature of the park compared with the surrounding urban areas. In order to determine the effect of air temperature differences because of the urban royal tomb park, Seolleung Royal Tomb Park (SPK) and the nearby Seolleung subway station (SLS), air tempera- tures were recorded at 10 min intervals from November 9th, 2007 to November 8th, 2008. The data were analyzed and examined to illustrate air temperature-reducing effects during the day and over the year. Results of the investi- gation show that the average air temperature differences due to SPK in the nearby SLS was 1.76C, and the maxi- mum air temperature-reducing effects due to SPK occur in September, not during the winter. The air temperature- reducing effect due to SPK decreases rapidly from the park boundary, because of the urban morphology and land use.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Mobile traverses were used to conduct air temperature observations to clarify the effect of land cover on ambient air temperatures. The study area was located in a suburb of the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan. The mobile traverses were conducted at 2 h intervals between 10:00 h on one day and 08:00 h the next day, on selected days from October 2006 to March 2008, for a total of 30 d. We observed an intra-urban heat island (IUHI) throughout the year and determined the diurnal and seasonal variations in this IUHI. The daily maximum intensities of the IUHI under calm and cloudless conditions ranged from 4.0 to 6.9°C during all seasons of the years examined. Such large IUHI intensities are determined by clear boundaries between adjacent land covers, independent of a city's size. The development of an IUHI is related to the features of the land cover, and the causal factors that enhance an IUHI differ between day- and nighttime. In most cases, observed air temperatures varied significantly according to ambient land cover types, and air temperatures decreased as the amount of vegetated area around the sites increased. These land cover effects were slightly stronger at night than during the day, and they weakened as the amount of cloud cover or the wind speed increased, especially at night.},

This paper assesses the impact of street trees in mitigating these issues. At twenty locations in the city, we compare segments of roads with and without trees, assessing the relationship of environmental differences with the presence or absence of street tree cover. Street segments with trees had on average lower temperature, humidity and pollution, with afternoon ambient air temperatures lower by as much as 5.6°C, road surface temperatures lower by as much as 27.5°C, and SO2levels reduced by as much as 65{\%}. Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) levels were very high on exposed roads, with 50{\%} of the roads showing levels approaching twice the permissible limits, while 80{\%} of the street segments with trees had SPM levels within prescribed limits. In an era of exacerbated urbanization and climate change, tropical cities such as Bangalore will have to face some of the worst impacts including air pollution and microclimatic alterations. The information generated in this study can help appropriately assess the environmental benefits provided by urban trees, providing useful inputs for urban planners. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

Annual, January and July mean temperatures for 21 stations in and around Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota were adjusted for background climate, differences in observation time, and changes in station location. The effect of the adjustments on the spatial structure of the urban heat island was judged by comparing isopleth analyses of the adjusted and unadjusted temperatures for each of the three time periods. Adjusted temperature data depict a larger heat island that conforms more closely to the urban structure. The influence of the adjustments on the strength of the heat island was estimated by comparing urban-rural temperature differences calculated from both data sets for the three time periods. The mean urban minus mean rural temperature differences calculated from the adjusted data are as much as 50{\%} larger than the differences calculated from the unadjusted data.},

Selected Papers from the Conference ICB-ICUC'99 WCASP-50 WMO/TD no. 1026] as a part of the land-surface boundary conditions of a mesoscale meteorological simulation model. The calculated results related to atmospheric temperature distribution were similar to observed values not only for daily averages but also for amplitudes and phases of diurnal change. To reproduce accurately, it is essential to reproduce urban characteristics such as an urban canopy and anthropogenic heat release in a fine resolution mesh. We attempted an analysis using current data for anthropogenic heat and under uniform heat release conditions, to investigate temporal and spatial characteristics in relation to the influence of anthropogenic heat release on the urban climate. The results of investigation into the influence of anthropogenic heat release on atmospheric temperature using current data indicate that the amount of heat released is lower at night than during the day, but the temperature rise is nearly 3 times greater. Results of investigation into the influence of anthropogenic heat release on wind systems using current data indicate that the onset of land breezes is delayed, particularly in a coastal area. Investigation into the temporal characteristics related to the influence of anthropogenic heat release under uniform heat release conditions showed a maximum influence on temperature during the predawn period. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The present paper deals with the dependence of outdoor thermal comfort on the design of an urban street. The effects of the street vertical profile, including asymmetrical canyon shapes, the use of galleries and further shading devices on the fa{\c{c}}ades, arranged in various orientations are assessed. The study is conducted by means of numerical modelling by using the three-dimensional microclimate model ENVI-met 3.0 which prognosticates the microclimatic changes within urban environments. Thermal comfort is evaluated for the daytime hours across the canyon in high spatial resolution and by means of the physiologically equivalent temperature PET. The results revealed that all design aspects investigated have a moderate impact on the air temperature and a strong effect on the heat gained by a human body and hence on the resulting thermal sensation. The larger the openness to the sky of the canyon, the higher the heat stress. For canyons with a smaller sky view, the orientation is also decisive: E-W canyons are the most stressful and deviating from this orientation ameliorates the thermal conditions. Basically, galleries and further shading through overhanging fa{\c{c}}ades or vegetation enable a sensitive decrease of the period of time and of the area of thermal discomfort. Yet, this efficiency varies with the orientation and the vertical proportions of the canyon. Therefore, if appropriately combined, all investigated design elements can effectively mitigate heat stress in the summer and promote thermal comfort. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The objective of this study is to simulate the characteristic role of building aspect ratio (AR) and wind speed on air temperatures during different street canyon heating situations. A two-dimensional Renormalization Group (RNG) k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model is employed to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and energy transport equations. A comparison of the results from the adopted model with those reported by similar experimental and numerical works demonstrated that the model is quite reliable when simulating temperature and wind profiles. The model is employed to predict air temperatures in idealized street canyons of aspect ratios (building-height-to-street-width ratio) of 0.5-8 with ambient wind speeds of 0.5-4 m/s. Three situations were identified for simulating diurnal heating of street canyon. It is noted that air temperatures are positively correlated with the bulk Richardson number (Rb) in most of the cases. The results show that the air temperature difference between high and low AR street canyon ($\Delta$$\theta$AR) was the highest during the nighttime (i.e., around 7.5 K between AR8 and AR0.5), but low or even negative during the daytime. It is also found that air temperatures rose as high as 1.3 K when ambient wind speed decreased from 4 m/s to 0.5 m/s. It is also revealed that the $\Delta$$\theta$ARduring different diurnal situations and the nighttime and daytime air temperature difference between urban and rural areas (Urban Heat Island, UHI) closely resemble one another. Conclusively, the results of this study have highlighted the importance of street canyon AR and wind speed on urban heating. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The temperature difference between an urban space and surrounding non-urban space is called the urban heat island effect (UHI). Global terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) can consume 1.4803×1023joules (J) of energy annually, which is about 21.74{\%} of the total available solar energy at the top of atmosphere, whereas annual human energy use is 4.935×1020J, about 0.33{\%} of annual ET energy consumption. Vegetation ET has great potential to reduce urban and global temperatures. Our literature review suggests that vegetation and urban agricultural ET can reduce urban temperatures by 0.5 to 4.0°C. Green roofs (including urban agriculture) and water bodies have also been shown to be effective ways of reducing urban temperatures. The cooling effects on the ambient temperature and the roof surface temperature can be 0.24-4.0°C and 0.8-60.0°C, respectively. The temperature of a water body (including urban aquaculture) can be lower than the temperature of the surrounding built environment by between 2 and 6°C, and a water body with a 16 m2surface area can cool up to 2 826 m3of nearby space by 1°C. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the increase of evapotranspiration in cities, derived from vegetation, urban agriculture, and water body, can effectively mitigate the effect of urban heat islands. {\textcopyright} 2013 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.},

abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) refers to the phenomenon of higher atmospheric and surface temperatures occurring in urban areas than in the surrounding rural areas. Mitigation of the UHI effects via the configuration of green spaces and sustainable design of urban environments has become an issue of increasing concern under changing climate. In this paper, the effects of the composition and configuration of green space on land surface temperatures (LST) were explored using landscape metrics including percentage of landscape (PLAND), edge density (ED) and patch density (PD). An oasis city of Aksu in Northwestern China was used as a case study. The metrics were calculated by moving window method based on a green space map derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, and LST data were retrieved from Landsat TM thermal band. A normalized mutual information measure was employed to investigate the relationship between LST and the spatial pattern of green space. The results showed that while the PLAND is the most important variable that elicits LST dynamics, spatial configuration of green space also has significant effect on LST. Though, the highest normalized mutual information measure was with the PLAND (0.71), it was found that the ED and PD combination is the most deterministic factors of LST than the unique effects of a single variable or the joint effects of PLAND and PD or PLAND and ED. Normalized mutual information measure estimations between LST and PLAND and ED, PLAND and PD and ED and PD were 0.7679, 0.7650 and 0.7832, respectively. A combination of the three factors PLAND, PD and ED explained much of the variance of LST with a normalized mutual information measure of 0.8694. Results from this study can expand our understanding of the relationship between LST and street trees and vegetation, and provide insights for sustainable urban planning and management under changing climate. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Due to its adverse impacts on urban ecological environment and the overall livability of cities, the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon has become a major research focus in various interrelated fields, including urban climatology, urban ecology, urban planning, and urban geography. This study sought to examine the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and the abundance and spatial pattern of impervious surface and green space in the metropolitan areas of Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia), and Manila (Philippines). Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data and various geospatial approaches, including urban-rural gradient, multiresolution grid-based, and spatial metrics-based techniques, were used to facilitate the analysis. We found a significant strong correlation between mean LST and the density of impervious surface (positive) and green space (negative) along the urban-rural gradients of the three cities, depicting a typical UHI profile. The correlation of impervious surface density with mean LST tends to increase in larger grids, whereas the correlation of green space density with mean LST tends to increase in smaller grids, indicating a stronger influence of impervious surface and green space on the variability of LST in larger and smaller areas, respectively. The size, shape complexity, and aggregation of the patches of impervious surface and green space also had significant relationships with mean LST, though aggregation had the most consistent strong correlation. On average, the mean LST of impervious surface is about 3 °C higher than that of green space, highlighting the important role of green spaces in mitigating UHI effects, an important urban ecosystem service. We recommend that the density and spatial pattern of urban impervious surfaces and green spaces be considered in landscape and urban planning so that urban areas and cities can have healthier and more comfortable living urban environments.},

abstract = {Urban areas will experience the greatest increases in temperature resulting from climate change due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Urban greenspace mitigates the UHI and provides cooler microclimates. Field research has established that temperatures within parks or beneath trees can be cooler than in non-greenspaces, but little is known about the effects of the spatial pattern of greenspace on urban temperatures or the optimal spatial patterns needed to cool an urban environment. Here, urban cool islands (UCIs) and greenspace in Nanjing, China were identified from satellite data and the relationship between them analyzed using correlation analyses. The results indicate the following: (1) Areas with a higher percentage of forest-vegetation experience a greater cooling effect and a 10{\%} increase in forest-vegetation area resulted in a decrease of about 0.83. °C in surface temperature; (2) A correlation analysis between mean patch size, patch density, and an aggregation index of forest vegetation with temperature reduction showed that for a fixed amount of forest vegetation, fragmented greenspaces also provide effective cooling; (3) The spatial pattern of UCIs was strongly correlated with greenspace patterns; a mainland-island greenspace spatial configuration provided an efficient means of enhancing the cooling effects; and (4) the intensity of the cooling effect was reflected in cool island characteristics. These findings will support better prediction of the effects of specific amounts and spatial arrangements of greenspace, helping city managers and planners mitigate increasing temperatures associated with climate change. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Urban ecosystems are profoundly modified by human activities and thereby provide a unique “natural laboratory” to study potential ecosystem responses to anthropogenic environmental changes. Because urban environments are now affected by urban heat islands, carbon dioxide domes, and high-level nitrogen deposition, to some extent they portend the future of the global ecosystem. Urbanization in the metropolitan region of Phoenix, Arizona (USA) has resulted in pronounced changes in air temperature (T air), atmospheric CO2 concentration, and nitrogen deposition (Ndep). In this study, we used a process-based ecosystem model to explore how the Larrea tridentata dominated Sonoran Desert ecosystem may respond to these urbanization-induced environmental changes. We found that water availability controls the magnitude and pattern of responses of the desert ecosystem to elevated CO2, air temperature, N deposition and their combinations. Urbanization effects were much stronger in wet years than normal and dry years. At the ecosystem level, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and soil organic matter (SOM) both increased with increasing CO2 and Ndep individually and in combinations with changes in T air. Soil N (Nsoil) responded positively to increased N deposition and air temperature, but negatively to elevated CO2. Correspondingly, ANPP and SOM of the Larrea ecosystem decreased along the urban–suburban–wildland gradient, whereas Nsoil peaked in the suburban area. At the plant functional type (FT) level, ANPP generally responded positively to elevated CO2 and Ndep, but negatively to increased T air. C3 winter annuals showed a greater ANPP response to higher CO2 levels ({\textgreater}420 ppm) than shrubs, which could lead over the long term to changes in species composition, because competition among functional groups is strong for resources such as soil water and nutrients. Overall, the combined effects of the three environmental factors depended on rainfall variability and nonlinear interactions within and between plant functional types and environmental factors. We intend to use these simulation results as working hypotheses to guide our field experiments and observations. Experimental testing of these hypotheses through this process should improve our understanding of urban ecosystems under increasing environmental stresses.},

abstract = {This paper shows the effects of several variables, which co-cause the Urban Heat Island effect on temperature distribution and outdoor thermal comfort (by using the Predicted Mean Vote, PMV) on dense urban environments. The study was conducted by means of a three-dimensional microclimate model, ENVI-met 3.1, which forecasts the microclimatic changes within urban environments. The effects of building density ({\%} of built area) and canyon effect (building height) on potential temperature, mean radiant temperature, and Predicted Mean Vote distribution are quantified. The influence of several types of green areas (vegetation on the ground and on roofs) on temperature mitigation and on comfort improvements is investigated for different atmospheric conditions and latitudes in a Mediterranean climate. The research quantifies the effects of the variables investigated on temperature distributions and in determining outdoor comfort conditions. Vegetation on the ground and on roofs mitigates summer temperatures, decreases the indoor cooling load demand, and improves outdoor comfort. The results of the study demonstrate that density and height of buildings in a city area influence potential temperature, mean radiant temperature, and Predicted Mean Vote distribution; for most of the cases examined higher density causes higher temperatures and with taller buildings vegetation has higher cooling effects. Considering the cooling effect of vegetation, a difference can be noticed depending on the amount of green areas and vegetation type. The results of this study show also that vegetation is more effective with higher temperatures and lower relative humidity values in mitigating potential temperatures, mean radiant temperatures, and PMV and in decreasing the cooling load demand. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Small increases in the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) are predictive of vascular events among asymptomatic individuals. There are few data supporting the use of CRP as a risk marker among nonwhite individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: 1250 adults of South Asian, Chinese, European, and Aboriginal ancestry were randomly sampled from 4 communities in Canada. Participants provided fasting blood samples for CRP, glucose, lipids, and coagulation factors, and they had undergone a carotid B-mode ultrasound. Cardiovascular disease was determined by history and electrocardiogram. The age- and sex-adjusted mean CRP was 3.74 mg/L (standard error, 0.14) among Aboriginals, 2.59 mg/L (0.12) among South Asians, and 1.18 mg/L (0.13) among Chinese compared with 2.06 mg/L (0.12) among Europeans (overall P{\textless}0.0001). Differences in the CRP concentration between ethnic groups were substantially diminished, but not abolished, after adjustment for metabolic factors. CRP was independently associated with CVD after adjusting for the Framingham risk factors, atherosclerosis, anthropometric measurements, and ethnicity (OR=1.03 for a 0.1-increase in CRP; P=0.02).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: CRP varies substantially between people of different ethnic origin and is influenced by their differences in metabolic factors. Prospective validation of CRP as a risk predictor for cardiovascular disease among nonwhite ethnic groups is required.},

Air temperature (mean, maximum ancL minimum) data of lstanbul and Ankara are analyzed to study regional climate change and to understand the possible effects of urbanization on the climate of these regions owing to industrialization and large flux of migration from rural parts of the country. For the trend analysis, linear regression and the sequential version of the Mann-Kendall test is used. A significant upward trend is found in the urban temperatures of southern |stanbul, which is the most highly populated and industrialized part of the city compared to its rural parts. Northern stations do not show any warming trend; instead, they have a cooling trend. Urbanization and industrialization in the southern part O f istanbul has a negative effect on regional cooling. In spite of Ankara's urban geometry and air pollution problem, the urban station in Ankara does not show any warming trend. A significant urban heat island intensity (urban-rural) is not observed in Ankara,},

abstract = {Urban green infrastructure can to a certain extent mitigate urban warming. However, the cooling effect of plants varies with space, time and plant-specific properties. To contribute to our understanding of the cooling effect of vegetation on urban surface and air temperature, 21 parks in Addis Ababa were studied. Air temperature and humidity were measured for 60 plots in nine of the parks for 15 days. Furthermore, the thermal band of Landsat ETM+ was used to examine the cooling impact of all 21 parks on a larger spatial scale. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the relationship between characteristics of the vegetation and observed temperature. It emerged that Eucalyptus sp. had a significantly higher cooling effect than any other species group (P{\textless}. 0.05) and the species with the least effect on temperature were Grevillea and Cupressus. On a larger spatial scale, the cooling effect of parks on their surroundings (Park Cooling Intensity, PCI) was positively related to the NDVI and area of parks (P{\textless}. 0.01). A negative relationship was observed between PCI and park shape index (SI). The range within which the cooling effect could be observed (Park Cooling Distance, PCD) was positively related to SI and park area. The maximum PCI was 6.72. °C and the maximum PCD was estimated at 240. m. We conclude that the cooling effect is mainly determined by species group, canopy cover, size and shape of parks. Thus, the study provides insights regarding the importance of species choice and spatial design of green spaces in cooling the environment. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {The heat island effect and the high use of fossil fuels in large city centers are well documented, but by how much fossil fuel consumption is elevating atmospheric CO2concentrations and whether elevations in both atmospheric CO2and air temperature from rural to urban areas are consistently different from year to year are less well known. Our aim was to record atmospheric CO2concentrations, air temperature and other environmental variables in an urban area and compare it to suburban and rural sites to see if urban sites are experiencing climates expected globally in the future with climate change. A transect was established from Baltimore city center (Urban site), to the outer suburbs of Baltimore (suburban site) and out to an organic farm (rural site). At each site a weather station was set-up to monitor environmental variables for 5 years. Atmospheric CO2was consistently and significantly increased on average by 66 ppm from the rural to the urban site over the 5 years of the study. Air temperature was also consistently and significantly higher at the urban site (14.8 °C) compared to the suburban (13.6 °C) and rural (12.7 °C) sites. Relative humidity was not different between sites whereas the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was significantly higher at the urban site compared to the suburban and rural sites. An increase in nitrogen deposition at the rural site of 0.6{\%} and 1.0{\%} compared to the suburban and urban sites was small enough not to affect soil nitrogen content. Dense urban areas with large populations and high vehicular traffic have significantly different microclimates compared to outlying suburban and rural areas. The increases in atmospheric CO2and air temperature are similar to changes predicted in the short term with global climate change, therefore providing an environment suitable for studying future effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems.},

abstract = {The objective of this research is to simulate the effects of vertical greenery systems on the temperature and energy consumption of buildings. Firstly, it involves performing TAS simulations to determine their effects on thermal comfort and energy consumption. It is found that 100{\%} greenery coverage from vertical greenery systems is effective in lowering the mean radiant temperature of a glass facade building. Furthermore, to lower the energy cooling load significantly, the shading coefficient of plant species has to be low. Secondly, a thermal calculation of the envelope thermal transfer value (ETTV) to obtain their effects on the thermal performance of building envelope is performed. Results show a linear correlation between shading coefficient and leaf area index where a lower shading coefficient leads to a greater thermal insulation. 50{\%} greenery coverage from vertical greenery systems and a shading coefficient of 0.041 reduce the ETTV of a glass facade building by 40.68{\%}. Lastly, vertical greenery systems in mitigating the UHI effect within an estate is simulated using STEVE model. The increase of greenery coverage from vertical greenery systems is most significantly felt with a drop in the minimum estate air temperature throughout a large region of the estate. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Studies on urban heat island (UHI) have been more than a century after the phenomenon was first discovered in the early 1800s. UHI emerges as the source of many urban environmental problems and exacerbates the living environment in cities. Under the challenges of increasing urbanization and future climate changes, there is a pressing need for sustainable adaptation/mitigation strategies for UHI effects, one popular option being the use of reflective materials. While it is introduced as an effective method to reduce temperature and energy consumption in cities, its impacts on environmental sustainability and large-scale non-local effect are inadequately explored. This paper provides a synthetic overview of potential environmental impacts of reflective materials at a variety of scales, ranging from energy load on a single building to regional hydroclimate. The review shows that mitigation potential of reflective materials depends on a set of factors, including building characteristics, urban environment, meteorological and geographical conditions, to name a few. Precaution needs to be exercised by city planners and policy makers for large-scale deployment of reflective materials before their environmental impacts, especially on regional hydroclimates, are better understood. In general, it is recommended that optimal strategy for UHI needs to be determined on a city-by-city basis, rather than adopting a "one-solution-fits-all" strategy.},

abstract = {Urban environment quality is worsening every year. It is a fact that the urban air temperature is gradually rising in all cities and some effective measures are needed to mitigate it. Planting of vegetation is one of the main strategies to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Large urban parks can extend positive effects to the surrounding built environment. National University of Singapore (NUS) complex can be considered as a "city" on a smaller scale. The greenery along Kent Ridge Road seems like a "rural" area, with a cooler ambient temperature. Some methodologies were employed in this study, such as satellite image, field measurement and computer simulations. The satellite image was used to identify the "hot" and "cool" spots in NUS environment. Field measurement was used to get the real temperature distribution across the campus and finally, computer simulation was used to predict some scenarios of different conditions. The result shows that buildings near or surrounded by greenery have lower ambient temperature than the ones away from the greenery and it is an effective way to lower the ambient temperature. The TAS simulation results also show that a rooftop garden has the potential of cooling energy savings for NUS buildings. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {Heat island is a very well documented climatic phenomenon that has an important energy and environmental impact in the urban environment. The main energy problems are related to the important increase of the energy consumption for cooling purposes as well as to the important increase of the peak electricity load. Heat island in Athens, Greece, is measured during the last decade and its energy impact is calculated in details. The aim of the present paper is to estimate the direct and indirect environmental impact of the heat island effect in Athens. This is achieved through the estimation of the additional ecological footprint caused by the urban heat island phenomenon over the city. The ecological footprint estimation is performed at a first step by calculating the increase of the cooling demand caused by the heat island over the whole city and then by translating the energy to environmental cost. Two years annual experimental data from many urban stations have been used. The results show that the ecological footprint because of the heat island ranges 1.5–2 times the city's political area that have to be reserved every year to compensate the additional CO2 emissions caused by the presence of the heat island effect while the maximum potential ecological footprint, provided that all buildings are air conditioned, is almost 110,000 hectares.},

abstract = {The urban heat island phenomenon occurs as a result of the mixed effects of anthropogenic heat discharge, increased use of artificial impervious surface materials, and decreased vegetation cover. These factors modify the heat balance at the land surface and eventually raise the atmospheric temperature. It is important to quantify the surface heat balance in order to estimate the contributions of these factors. The present authors propose the use of storage heat flux to represent the heat flux between the land surface and the inside of the canopy for the heat balance analysis based on satellite remote sensing data. Surface heat fluxes were estimated around the city of Nagoya, Japan using Terra ASTER data and meteorological data. Seasonal and day-night differences in heat balance were compared using ASTER data acquired in the daytime on July 10, 2000, and January 2, 2004 and in the nighttime on September 26, 2003. In the central business and commercial districts, the storage heat flux was higher than those in the surrounding residential areas. In particular, in winter, the storage heat flux in the central urban area was 240 to 290 W m- 2, which was much larger than the storage heat fluxes in residential areas, which ranged from 180 to 220 W m- 2. Moreover, the negative storage heat flux in the central urban area was greater at night. This tendency implies that the urban surface stores heat during the daytime and discharges it at night. Extremely large negative storage heat flux occurred primarily in the industrial areas for both daytime and nighttime as a result of the enormous energy consumption by factories. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Since the 1980s, China has undergone rapid urbanization. Meanwhile, the climate has been warming substantially. In this paper, the urbanization effect on observed temperatures from 1980 to 2009 in China is estimated, based on analysis of urban land use from satellite observation. Urban land-use expansion ($\Delta$U) during 1980–2005 is applied as an urbanization index. According to these $\Delta$U values, stations are divided into three categories: (C1) intense urbanization around the stations; (C2) moderate urbanization around the stations; and (C3) minimal urbanization around the stations. Most C1 stations are in municipalities or provincial capitals, while C2 stations tend to be in prefecture-level cities. C3 stations are mostly in counties. The urban heat island (UHI) effect can be estimated if the urban effect on C3 is negligible. The warming of C1 or C2 relative to that of C3 represents their urbanization effects, assuming that the same larger-scale natural warming has affected each category. For C1, the local urbanization effect is 0.258°C/10 a over 1980–2009, accounting for 41{\%} of the total warming; the trend at C2 is 0.099°C/10 a, or 21{\%}. For all China, the urbanization effect is 0.09°C/10a, accounting for 20{\%} of the total national warming. Winter urban warming is greater than in summer. The assumption of negligible urbanization effect on C3 is debatable, and so the true urbanization effect may equal or slightly exceed estimates. Further, the $\Delta$U index may have some uncertainties, for it is only one of the urbanization indices. However, it provides a new and direct estimation of environmental change, in contrast to indirect indices.},

Four biometeorological indices were calculated in order to evaluate human thermal sensation and thermal comfort: Actual Sensation Vote (ASV), Thermal Sensation-Ginovi method (TS), Discomfort Index (DI) and Heat Load Index (HL). Data included measurements of ambient temperature, temperature of the surrounding ground surface, relative humidity, air pressure, wind velocity and solar radiation obtained from National Observatory of Athens (NOA) station. During this period the daily number of patients probably affected by heat in emergency department units of cardiac clinics of four public general hospitals in Athens was recorded. The results revealed high values of DI and HL indices, demonstrating severe heat stress conditions during the last ten day period of June and July, while the ASV tends to classify too many cases into the comfort zone compared to TS, DI and HL. The statistical analysis revealed a negative relationship between the number of heat affected patients and the estimated indices values. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Further, the effects of different planetary boundary layer schemes [Eta and Medium-Range Forecast (MRF) PBLs] for Noah LSM and soil moisture initialization approaches for Pleim–Xiu LSM are investigated. The investigation focuses on the evaluation and comparison of diurnal cycle intensity and maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as the urban heat island during the daytime and nighttime under the clear-sky and cloudy/rainy weather conditions for different experimental schemes. The results indicate that 1) there is an evident difference between Noah LSM and Pleim–Xiu LSM in simulating the near-surface air temperature, especially in the modeled urban heat island; 2) there is no evident difference in the model performance between the Eta PBL and MRF PBL coupled with the Noah LSM; and 3) soil moisture initialization is of crucial importance for model performance in the Pleim–Xiu LSM. In addition, owing to the recent release of MM5, version 3.7.3, some experiments done with version 3.7.2 were repeated to reveal the effects of the modifications in the Noah LSM and Pleim–Xiu LSM. The modification to longwave radiation parameterizations in Noah LSM significantly improves model performance while the adjustment of emissivity, one of the vegetation properties, affects Pleim–Xiu LSM performance to a larger extent. The study suggests that improvements both in Noah LSM physics and in Pleim–Xiu LSM initialization of soil moisture and parameterization of vegetation properties are important.},

The classification divides urban and rural landscapes into 17 standard classes, each defined by structural and land cover properties that influence air temperature at screen height. This study is the first to evaluate the conceptual division of LCZs with temperature observations and simulation results from surface–atmosphere models. Results confirm that thermal contrasts exist among all LCZ classes, and that such contrasts are governed largely by building height and spacing, pervious surface fraction, tree density, and soil wetness. Therefore, partitioning of landscapes into structural and land cover classes, or ‘LCZs,' is deemed justified for the purposes of field site classification in heat island studies. Also justified is the use of inter-zone temperature difference (TLCZ X−Y) to quantify heat island magnitude. To further improve the LCZ system, we encourage other researchers to observe and model the climatic conditions of its varied classes. Especially useful would be tests using field data from different urban and rural environments to those in this study, and running more advanced urban canopy models with demonstrated predictive capability.},

abstract = {Empirical models of minimum (Tmin), average (Tavg) and maximum (Tmax) air temperature for Singapore estate have been developed and validated based on a long-tem field measurement. There are three major urban elements, which influence the urban temperature at the local scale. Essentially, they are buildings, greenery and pavement. Other related parameters identified for the study, such as green plot ratio (GnPR), sky view factor (SVF), surrounding building density, the wall surface area, pavement area, albedo are also evaluated to give a better understanding on the likely impact of the modified urban morphology on energy consumption.The objective of this research is to assess and to compare how the air temperature variation of urban condition can affect the building energy consumption in tropical climate of Singapore. In order to achieve this goal, a series of numerical calculation and building simulation are utilized. A total of 32 cases, considering different urban morphologies, are identified and evaluated to give better a understanding on the implication of urban forms, with the reference to the effect of varying density, height and greenery density. The results show that GnPR, which related to the present of greenery, have the most significant impact on the energy consumption by reducing the temperature by up to 2°C. The results also strongly indicate an energy saving of 4.5{\%} if the urban elements are addressed effectively. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the impact of the urban heat island (UHI) in the Tokyo metropolitan area on energy consumption in the residential and commercial sectors. Although there are many indications that UHIs increase energy consumption by air conditioners, the possible decrease in consumption of heating energy in winter is usually ignored. To quantify the net impact of a UHI, it is crucial to consider both factors. Furthermore, it is important to consider the spatial distribution because a UHI represents the local temperature change in an urban area, and the spatial distribution of energy consumption in an urban area is complicated. We developed a new method to evaluate UHI impact by taking into consideration the spatial and temporal distributions of both energy consumption and air temperature. The results reveal that the UHI increases commercial energy consumption in the Tokyo metropolitan area but decreases residential energy consumption; however, there is a total net decrease in energy consumption. This suggests that UHI mitigation measures should particularly target the city center, where commercial buildings are concentrated, whereas in residential areas, sufficient assessments must be conducted to ensure that mitigation measures are introduced with caution. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The evolution of the Parisian urban climate under a changing climate is analyzed from long-term offline numerical integrations including a specific urban parameterization. This system is forced by meteorological conditions based on presentclimate reanalyses (1970–2007), and climate projections (2071–2099) provided by global climate model simulations following two emission scenarios (A1B and A2). This study aims at quantifying the impact of climate change on air temperature within the city and in the surroundings. A systematic increase of 2-meter air temperature is found. In average according to the two scenarios, it reaches +2.0/2.4◦C in winter and +3.5/5.0◦C in summer for the minimum and maximum daily temperatures, respectively. During summer, the warming trend is more pronounced in the surrounding countryside than in Paris and suburbs due to the soil dryness. As a result, a substantial decrease of the strong urban heat islands is noted at nighttime, and numerous events with negative urban heat islands appear at daytime. Finally, a 30{\%} decrease of the heating degree days is quantified in winter between present and future climates. Inversely, the summertime cooling degree days significantly increase in future climate whereas they are negligible in present climate. However, in terms of accumulated degree days, the increase of the demand in cooling remains smaller than the decrease of the demand in heating.},

abstract = {In the present work, an experimental urban canyon (scale 1:10) with 4. cm concrete wall thickness and full scale green roof was used to evaluate the impact of green roof inside and outside the buildings. The platform was equally used to validate a coupled heat and mass transfer model for green roof behavior. The albedo of the green roof was measured and implemented in the numerical model. The developed model has been coupled to a building thermal code (TRNSYS). Then, simulations were conducted for the experimental urban canyon studied where a comparison was undertaken between green and conventional roofing. A reduction of the maximum roof surface temperature by 20. °C was found in summer due to the green roof. Green roof protects the roof membrane from high temperature fluctuations increasing the roof longevity and delay the timing of the peak membrane surface temperature by several hours. Also, the presence of vegetation permits to reduce the outside air temperature of the street canyon by 0.8. °C. Hence, green roofing is an effective solution to reduce the total energy demand and to improve the urban microclimate in the street canyon for an oceanic temperate climate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The aim of the experimental campaign was first to evaluate the potential of natural ventilation in the urban environment and second to better understand the air flow and thermal phenomena in deep urban canyons. Extensive measurements of the surface and air temperature as well as the wind speed in the middle and close to the canyon fa{\c{c}}ades have been measured in a continuous basis. In parallel, the undisturbed temperature, wind speed and direction above the canyon have been measured as well. Measurements of the airflow rate in single side and cross ventilation configurations have been carried out using tracer gas techniques, in a naturally ventilated building located in the canyon. It is found that the potential of natural ventilation for both single side and cross ventilation configurations in buildings located inside urban canyons, is seriously reduced. It is estimated, that in the specific canyon, the airflow rate for single side and cross ventilation configurations, is reduced by 82 and 68{\%}, respectively compared to an undisturbed location. The mechanism of the air flow and temperature distribution inside the canyon is extensively analysed and the specific phenomena that determine the wind speed and direction inside the canyon are described in details. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

These ceramics enable their vertical surfaces to be wet up to a level higher than 100 cm when their lower end is placed in water. Our previous study has demonstrated the cooling performance and applicability of a prototype PECW constructed of pipe-shaped ceramics (ceramic pipes). The present paper presents a PECW unit system which can be easily installed for practical applications. Experiments were conducted using experimental PECW units. Experimental results show that the ceramic pipe developed in this study possessed a higher water-holding and soaking-up ability than the previous one. Wet surfaces of the new ceramic pipe reached a height of over 130 cm at an outdoor location exposed to solar radiation on sunny summer days. Furthermore, the air passing through the PECW unit was cooled, and its temperature can be reduced by around 2 ??C during summer daytime. These results indicate that the proposed PECW can be broadly applied to various urban locations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The use of highly reflective materials in buildings and urban structures reduces the absorbed solar radiation and contributes to mitigate heat island. This paper presents the results of a study aiming to measure and analyze the solar spectral properties and the thermal performance of 5 color thin layer asphalt samples in comparison to a sample of conventional black asphalt. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is used for evaluating the thermal and energy impact of applying the samples in outdoor spaces (roads). The spectrophotometric measurements showed that the colored thin layer asphalt samples are characterized by higher values of solar reflectance compared to the conventional asphalt, which is mainly due to their high near infrared solar reflectance. From the statistical analysis of the surface temperatures it was found that all the colored thin layer asphalt samples demonstrate lower surface temperatures compared to conventional asphalt. The maximum temperature difference recorded was for the off-white sample and was equal to 12 °C. The CFD simulation results show that surface and air temperatures are decreased when applying the color thin layer sample. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite differences in regional climates, cities world-wide have developed one common characteristic - the urban heat island (UHI). Its magnitude is related to city size, especially under cloudless sky conditions on a regional basis, although individual cities may be impacted by such local factors as proximity to large water bodies or prevailing winds. The UHI pattern in the small city of Ljutomer was examined in order to assess its intensity and morphology and to test the utility of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method in modeling the regression relationships between mean air temperature and related influence factors in this small-scale urban example. Significant differences in mean air temperature between urban and rural areas were measured. It turned out that built-up areas in Ljutomer are on average 1°C warmer than the rural surroundings in winter time. The regression analyses confirmed the important role of local non-stationary explanatory variables - distance to urban area, topographic position index and land-cover diversity - and global stationary variables - building volume per area and northness - in explaining spatial variation in mean air temperature. The relationships between mean air temperature and these five explanatory variables produced an overall model fit of 91{\%}, utilizing the semiparametric GWR method, which was tested on the smallest scale so far published. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {With increasing the solar reflectance of urban surfaces, the outflow of short-wave solar radiation increases, less solar heat energy is absorbed leading to lower surface temperatures and reduced outflow of thermal radiation into the atmosphere. This process of "negative radiative forcing" effectively counters global warming. Cool roofs also reduce cooling-energy use in air conditioned buildings and increase comfort in unconditioned buildings; and cool roofs and cool pavements mitigate summer urban heat islands, improving outdoor air quality and comfort. Installing cool roofs and cool pavements in cities worldwide is a compelling win-win-win activity that can be undertaken immediately, outside of international negotiations to cap CO2emissions. We review the status of cool roof and cool pavements technologies, policies, and programs in the U.S.; Europe, and Asia. We propose an international campaign to use solar reflective materials when roofs and pavements are built or resurfaced in temperate and tropical regions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Solar radiation attenuation in Mexico City is estimated by comparing global radiation intensity observed at a station in the downtown area, relative to that observed in a cleaner rural air at a site 8 km northeast of the airport. On average, the city receives on clear days during the dry season 21.6{\%} less solar energy than the rural surroundings. Similar values of attenuation are observed during the rainy season when aerosol concentration is abated by a wash‐out effect. As expected, solar dimming shows an inverse relation to wind and temperature. Attenuation reaches its maximum (25–35{\%}) with prevailing weak winds (1–2 m/s) and high noon relative humidity. In the city, variation of global radiation by the day of week, shows that solar attenuation is highest on Tuesdays, while on Saturdays solar dimming by smog was less. Since a similar weekly variation (with lower values) was observed at the rural site, the conclusion was that the smog layer affects the solar radiation climate in rural areas beyond the immediate city limits. The declining annual mean of maximum temperatures observed near the limits of the Mexico City basin, suggests that the smog layer is affecting the radiation and thermal climate of a vast region downwind of the capital city.

An attempt is made to show that while in the industrial and downtown areas the day time heat island effect dominates over the cooling effect of aerosols, in other suburban and rural sites downwind and away from the warm air mass, the reflecting properties of the smog layer seem to prevail resulting in an observed decreasing trend in maximum temperatures. From the above it may be concluded that maximum temperatures continue to rise in downtown Mexico City in spite of the attenuation due to absorption and reflection of incoming solar energy by the smog layer. },

abstract = {In 2008, the global urban population exceeded the nonrural population for the first time in history, and it is estimated that by 2050, 70{\%} of the world population will live in urban areas, with more than half of them concentrated in Asia. Although there are projections of future urban population growth, there is significantly less information about how these changes in demographics correspond with changes in urban extent. Urban land-use and land-cover changes have considerable impacts on climate. It has been well established that the urban heat island effect is more significant during the night than day and that it is affected by the shape, size, and geometry of buildings as well as the differences in urban and rural gradients. Recent research points to mounting evidence that urbanization also affects cycling of water, carbon, aerosols, and nitrogen in the climate system. This review highlights advances in the understanding of urban land-use trends and associated climate impacts, concentrating on peer-reviewed papers that have been published over the last two years. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The effects of urban heat islands (UHIs) have a substantial bearing on the sustainability of cities and environs. This paper examines the efficacy of green and cool roofs as potential UHI mitigation strategies to make cities more resilient against UHI. We have employed the urbanized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (uWRF) model at high (1 km) resolution with physically-based rooftop parameterization schemes (conventional, green and cool), a first-time application to the Chicago metropolitan area. We simulated a hot summer period (16–18 August 2013) and assessed (i) UHI reductions for different urban landuse with green/cool roofs, (ii) the interaction of lake breeze and UHI, and (iii) diurnal boundary layer dynamics. The performance of uWRF was evaluated using sensible heat flux and air temperature measurements from an urban mini-field campaign. The simulated roof surface energy balance captured the energy distribution with respective rooftop algorithms. Results showed that daytime roof temperature reduced and varied linearly with increasing green roof fractions, from less than 1 °C for the case of 25{\%} green roof to {\~{}}3 °C during peak daytime for 100{\%} green roof. Diurnal transitions from land to lake breeze and vice versa had a substantial impact on the daytime cycle of roof surface UHI, which had a 3–4 hour lag in comparison to 2 m UHI. Green and cool roofs reduced horizontal and vertical wind speeds and affected lower atmosphere dynamics, including reduced vertical mixing, lower boundary layer depth, and weaker convective rolls. The lowered wind speeds and vertical mixing during daytime led to stagnation of air near the surface, potentially causing air quality issues. The selection of green and cool roofs for UHI mitigation should therefore carefully consider the competing feedbacks. The new results for regional land-lake circulations and boundary layer dynamics from this study may be extended to other urbanized areas, particularly to coastal areas.},

abstract = {The Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (ARW) coupled with an urban canopy model is used to investigate the potential of vegetative (green) roof technology to mitigate against ongoing climate warming and continued urban sprawl for a day representing average summer conditions in late-twenty-first-century Chicago, Illinois. Effects related particularly to human health hazards resulting from excessive heat and high pollution concentrations are emphasized. Continued expansion of the urban environment over the next century is shown to lead to an expansion of the warming signal across the metropolitan region. Widespread adoption of vegetative rooftops, through increased albedo and evapotranspiration, reduces temperatures in the urban environment by as much as 38C, an effect similar to the simpler but less appealing alternative of employing painted or other reflective rooftop structures (e.g., white roofs). A significant limitation to the green roof approach for the case studied is that the increase in moisture resulting from transpiration leads to only marginal cooling when apparent temperatures are considered. An additional complication arises in that the reduced temperatures alter the lake-breeze circulation, potentially reducing circulation of pollutants into the city core, but also reducing natural cooling in the most urbanized areas during the climatologically warmest hours. Future work that evaluates these impacts over a broader range of synoptic settings, documents changes in the planetary boundary layer structure and attendant pollution, and considers the multiple-day dependence of these effects is needed. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Green roofs have been recognized as an effective sustainable design tool to mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effects. Previous studies have identified green-roof benefits in cooling and energy-conservation at the building scale, with limited exploration of the wider influence on neighborhood microclimate and human thermal comfort (HTC). This paper investigated the impacts of community-scale green-roof installation on air temperature and HTC in five typical residential neighborhoods of subtropical Hong Kong. The microclimate models ENVI-met and RayMan permitted studies of two main  green-roof scenarios, namely extensive (EGR) and intensive (IGR). Microclimatic monitoring data from a local experimental green-roof site validated the modeling methods. The results verified that green-roof cooling effects were not restricted to rooftops, but extended to the ground to improve neighborhood microclimate. EGR reduced pedestrian-level air temperature by 0.4–0.7 °C, and IGR by 0.5–1.7 °C, with maximum effect in open-set low rise sites. Coverage by building footprints and building height dampened lateral and vertical advection of cool air generated by green roofs. Roof greening also improved notably the rooftop-podium level HTC. Diurnal duration of high heat stress was reduced by 6–9 h for EGR scenarios, and 9–11 h for IGR. The findings indicated that large-scale green-roof installation could bring neighborhood-wide cooling, mitigate urban heat island effect, and furnish more comfortable thermal environment for urban residents.},

@article{Makar2006,
abstract = {The flux of heat from human activities such as commercial energy use, renewable source combustion, and the human metabolism has been incorporated into a variable resolution global weather forecast model, along with improved urban surface roughness and radiative properties. Sensitivity studies of these changes were used to show that the addition of anthropogenic heat improves the accuracy of surface air temperature forecasts. The addition of urban surface radiative properties has a secondary effect on the forecast temperature, and the addition of urban surface roughness changes has a minimal effect. Comparisons between observed and forecast boundary layer heights suggest that this parameter is poorly predicted by the model employed here, but that the impact of anthropogenic heating is likely to be a substantial increase in PBL heights over urban regions. Decreased atmospheric stability is also evidenced by comparisons of the diffusion constants for heat and moisture between the original and modified models, which show increases from a factor of 2 to a factor of 16 near the surface, depending on the size of the city. An examination of the effects of spatial averaging on heat flux suggests that significant sub-gridscale anthropogenic heating effects may occur, and implies that the results of the current simulations represent lower bounds. The simulations suggest that anthropogenic heat flux has a large local impact, with important implications for simulations of air-quality and radiative balance on regional and global scales.

A parametric study into different geometries and orientations of urban courtyard blocks in the Netherlands was therefore conducted for the hottest day in the Dutch reference year (19th June 2000 with the maximum 33. °C air temperature). The study also considered the most severe climate scenario for the Netherlands for the year 2050. Three urban heat mitigation strategies that moderate the microclimate of the courtyards were investigated: changing the albedo of the facades of the urban blocks, including water ponds and including urban vegetation. The results showed that a north-south canyon orientation provides the shortest and the east-west direction the longest duration of direct sun at the centre of the courtyards. Moreover, increasing the albedo of the facades actually increased the mean radiant temperature in a closed urban layout such as a courtyard. In contrast, using a water pool and urban vegetation cooled the microclimates; providing further evidence of their promise as strategies for cooling cities. The results are validated through a field measurement and calibration. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In Japan, reclaimed wastewater has been recycled widely for non-potable urban applications and it is to be used for sprinkling roads to mitigate heat island in urban areas. To assess the heat island mitigation effects of the sprinkling reclaimed wastewater on water retentive pavement, we carried out a survey at Shiodome-District, Tokyo. The temperatures of air and roads, humidity, and WBGT (Wet-bulb globe temperature) were measured and heat flux was estimated to compare the condition of the areas with/without sprinkling. The following results were obtained. 1) Sprinkling reclaimed wastewater decreased the road surface temperature by 8 degrees during the daytime and by 3 degrees at night: temperatures equal to those on planting zones. Nevertheless sprinkling was done only in the daytime, the temperature decrease effect was not only obtained during the daytime: it continued through the night, due to the water retentive pavement. 2) Sprinkling reclaimed wastewater reduced the amount of sensible heat flux and increased that of latent heat flux. These results suggest that sprinkling reclaimed wastewater on water retentive pavement can effectively mitigate the heat island phenomenon.},

As a result, the sea breeze frequently penetrates into the heavily urbanized area, extending about 20 km from the bayshore. Since the sea breeze is coupled with the heat island, it does not penetrate farther inland. A convergence zone persists over the urbanized area, which in turn results in very high concentrations of pollutants. An analysis of a typical episode is also discussed to more realistically describe the behavior of air pollution than for the averaged case.},

Furthermore, negative shifts were 20{\%} more common than positive shifts. Homogenized temperature anomaly series that were constructed for six 5 degrees latitude x 5 degrees longitude grid boxes indicate that the temporal pattern of temperture changes has been similar in different parts of Sweden since 1861. The annual mean temperature over Sweden was found to have increased by 0.68 degrees C from the period 1861-1890 to 1965-1994. The corresponding changes for the seasons were: +0.18 degrees C (winter), +1.40 (spring), +0.42 (summer) and +0.60 (autumn). A direct comparson shows that non-homogeneities in the temperature series from individual grid boxes in a global data set can be as large as the total changes observed. We estimate that a 95 per cent confidence interval for the error, due to non-homogeneous long station records, in estimates of hemispheric temperature changes over land regions since the period 1861-1890 is +/-0.1 degrees C for the Northern Hemisphere and the globe and +/-0.25 degrees C for the Southern Hemisphere. For a region consisting of about five grid boxes, this error is +/-0.5 degrees C. The large non-homogeneities in individual grid-box series in the global data set is partly a consequence of the fact that homogeneous climate data are not always easily available for the open research community. We urge that efforts are made to improve this situation},

abstract = {Urban Heat Islands (UHI) are urban and suburban areas with elevated surface and air temperatures relative to surrounding rural areas. This study combines variables from the remote sensing and urban climatology publications to explain UHI intensity in eight Chicago neighborhoods. During the summer of 2010, we collected air temperature measurements within an urban block in each neighborhood. Consistent with remote sensing research that measures surface temperature, the predictors of elevated nighttime air temperatures were land cover variables. At 2. a.m., the urban block's percentages of impervious surface and tree canopy explained 68{\%} of the variation in air temperature. At 2. a.m., the other physical measures of urban canyon and street orientation were not significant. At 2. a.m. during extreme heat events, the urban block's percentages of impervious surface and tree canopy explained 91{\%} of the variation in air temperature. At 4. p.m., the only significant explanatory variable was distance to industrial sites and this explained 26{\%} of the variation in air temperature. At 4. p.m. during extreme heat events, there were no significant predictors. We believe this research illustrates the importance of differentiating time of day for residential and non-residential areas in UHI mitigation efforts and the need to include waste heat in future UHI investigations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

In this case study the focus is on those interventions that can be performed, especially on enclosed urban contexts, to control the thermal environment. It pays attention on the effect of the vegetation and high albedo materials characterizing horizontal and vertical boundaries of the site and the Cloister by Giuliano da Sangallo, a historical site in Rome, is taken as case study. The model of the site was simulated with the software ENVI-met and it was verified thanks to a measurement campaign in situ. Five scenarios with different vertical and horizontal materials of the present buildings were simulated together with an analysis of the variations of physical quantities (air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity, wind speed) affecting the perception of environmental comfort (calculated through the Predicted Mean Vote). The result is that in those areas characterized by a Mediterranean climate, where the summer months with high temperatures must be mitigated, the vegetation can be a significant benefit to the environment, and high albedo materials can ease the thermal load of the buildings with a higher thermal stress for the pedestrians.},

abstract = {A consequence of urban heat islands in summer is an increase in the use of air conditioning in urbanized areas, which while cooling the insides of buildings, releases waste heat to the atmosphere. A coupled model consisting of a meso-scale meteorological model (MESO-NH) and an urban energy balance model (TEB) has been used to simulate and quantify the potential impacts on street temperature of four air conditioning scenarios at the scale of Paris. The first case consists of simulating the current types of systems in the city and was based on inventories of dry and evaporative cooling towers and free cooling systems with the river Seine. The other three scenarios were chosen to test the impacts of likely trends in air conditioning equipment in the city: one for which all evaporative and free cooling systems were replaced by dry systems, and the other two designed on a future doubling of the overall air conditioning power but with different technologies. The comparison between the scenarios with heat releases in the street and the baseline case without air conditioning showed a systematic increase in the street air temperature, and this increase was greater at nighttime than day time. It is counter-intuitive because the heat releases are higher during the day. This is due to the shallower atmospheric boundary layer during the night. The increase in temperature was 0.5 degree C in the situation with current heat releases, 1 degree C with current releases converted to only sensible heat, and 2 degree C for the future doubling of air conditioning waste heat released to air. These results demonstrated to what extent the use of air conditioning could enhance street air temperatures at the scale of a city like Paris, and the importance of a spatialized approach for a reasoned planning for future deployment of air conditioning in the city.},

abstract = {The large-scale planting of shade trees in urban areas to counteract heat-island effects and to minimize energy use is currently being discussed. Among the costs to be considered in a cost/benefit analysis of such a program is the potential for additional reactive organic compounds in the atmosphere due to emissions from these trees. In this program, 15 species of potential shade trees for the Los Angeles Air Basin were studied and emission rates were determined for 11 of these trees, with one further tree (Crape myrtle) exhibiting no detectable emissions. The emission rates normalized to dry leaf weight and corrected to 30°C were (in $\mu$g g-1 h-1), ranked from lowest to highest emission rate: Crape myrtle, none detected; Camphor, 0.03; Aleppo pine, 0.15; Deodar cedar, 0.29; Italian Stone pine, 0.42; Monterey pine, 0.90; Brazilian pepper, 1.3; Canary Island pine, 1.7; Ginkgo, 3.0; California pepper, 3.7; Liquidambar, 37; Carrotwood, 49. In addition to the emission rates per unit biomass, the biomass per tree must be factored into any assessment of the relative merits of the various trees, since some trees have higher biomass constants than others. The present data shows that there are large differences in emission rates among different tree species and this should be factored into decision-making as to which shade trees to plant. Based solely on the presently determined emission rates, the Crape myrtle and Camphor tree are good choices for large-scale planting, while the Carrotwood tree and Liquidambar are poor choices due to their high isoprene emission rates. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The increase in the number and severity of weather extremes (including excessive heat) potentially associated with climate change has highlighted the needs for research into risk assessment and risk reduction measures. Extreme heat events, the focus of this paper, have been consistently reported as the leading cause of weather-related mortality in the United States in recent years. In order to fully understand impact potentials and analyze risk in its individual components both the spatially and temporally varying patterns of heat and the multidimensional characteristics of vulnerability have to be considered. In this paper we present a composite index aggregating these factors to assess heat related risk for the U.S. National Capital Region in 2010. The study reveals how risk patterns are in part driven by the geographic variations of vulnerability, generally showing a clear difference between high-risk urban areas and wide areas of low risk in the suburban and rural environments. This pattern is particularly evident for the core center of the study area around the District of Columbia, which is largely characterized by high index values despite not having experienced the peak of the heat stress as compared to other regions in the metropolitan area. The article aims to set a framework for local-level heat stress risk assessment that can provide valuable input and decision support for climate adaptation planning as well as emergency managers aiming at risk reduction and optimization of resource distribution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A detailed study of urban bias in surface temperatures of China's northern plains is described. Temperatures of climatological surface stations were examined using a statistical rank-score procedure that allows screening of the data without knowledge of the station history information. Time series found to exhibit large potential discontinuities (i.e., those introduced as a result of nonclimatic factors such as observation schedule changes, instrument replacements, and station moves) were excluded from further analysis. In addition to the usual total population statistics, census area classifications and population densities were used to distinguish between 21 urban and 8 rural stations. Location-related biases associated with latitude and longitude positions were first removed from all station data, however, using ordinary least-squares regression techniques. Finally, a systematic sampling strategy was employed to estimate magnitudes and trends of urban bias in annual and seasonal mean temperatures. Results of the study indicate that temperatures for stations located in or near the most highly and densely populated urban centers exhibit the largest biases. For most of these urban stations, magnitudes and trends of the bias are greater during spring or summer than during autumn or winter. Standard errors of the estimated urban biases are large, however. Therefore, only the regionally averaged temperatures were adjusted to remove magnitudes and trends of urban bias. Trends in the original and adjusted temperatures of this study and in gridded temperatures taken from the widely used dataset of Jones et al. were also compared. It is suggested that despite past efforts to remove the effects of the urban heat islands from this and other large-scale, land-surface datasets, large urban warming biases may still remain.},

The paper reports the results of a large application in an office/laboratory building belonging to a school campus in Trapani, on the west coast of Sicily. The experiment was carried out in two phases. The building was continuously monitored during the first phase from late April to late September 2009: indoor and outdoor air temperatures, relative humidity and solar radiation were acquired. The monitoring was carried out before and after the cool eco-friendly white paint application, characterised by high solar reflectance and thermal emittance. The monitored data were used to calibrate the building model input into a dynamic simulation tool, used to evaluate the building performance with a number of variants. The analysis gave interesting results on the potential of this technique for the southern European climatic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We investigate the role of the anthropogenic heat flux on the urban heat island of London. To do this, the time-varying anthropogenic heat flux is added to an urban surface-energy balance parametrization, the Met Office-Reading Urban Surface Exchange Scheme (MORUSES), implemented in a 1 km resolution version of the UK Met Office Unified Model. The anthropogenic heat flux is derived from energy-demand data for London and is specified on the model's 1 km grid; it includes variations on diurnal and seasonal time-scales. We contrast a spring case with a winter case, to illustrate the effects of the larger anthropogenic heat flux in winter and the different roles played by thermodynamics in the different seasons. The surface-energy balance channels the anthropogenic heat into heating the urban surface, which warms slowly because of the large heat capacity of the urban surface. About one third of this additional warming goes into increasing the outgoing long-wave radiation and only about two thirds goes into increasing the sensible heat flux that warms the atmosphere. The anthropogenic heat flux has a larger effect on screen-level temperatures in the winter case, partly because the anthropogenic flux is larger then and partly because the boundary layer is shallower in winter. For the specific winter case studied here, the anthropogenic heat flux maintains a well-mixed boundary layer through the whole night over London, whereas the surrounding rural boundary layer becomes strongly stably stratified. This finding is likely to have important implications for air quality in winter. On the whole, inclusion of the anthropogenic heat flux improves the comparison between model simulations and measurements of screen-level temperature slightly and indicates that the anthropogenic heat flux is beginning to be an important factor in the London urban heat island. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Very detailed maps of anthropogenic heat in Tokyo were drawn with data from energy statistics and a very detailed digital geographic land use data set including the number of stories of building at each grid point. Animated computer graphics of the annual and diurnal variability in Tokyo's anthropogenic heat were also prepared with the same data sources. These outputs characterize scenarios of anthropogenic heat emission and can be applied to a numerical simulation model of the local climate. The anthropogenic heat flux in central Tokyo exceeded 400Wm-2in daytime, and the maximum value was 1590Wm-2in winter. The hot water supply in offices and hotels contributed 51{\%} of this 1590Wm-2. The anthropogenic heat flux from the household sector in the suburbs reached about 30Wm-2at night. Numerical simulations of urban climate in Tokyo were performed by referring to these maps. A heat island appeared evident in winter because of weakness of the sea breeze from Tokyo Bay. At 8 p.m., several peaks of high-temperature appeared, around Otemachi, Shinjuku and Ikebukuro; the areas with the largest anthropogenic heat fluxes. In summer the shortwave radiation was strong and the influence of anthropogenic heat was relatively small. In winter, on the other hand, the shortwave radiation was weak and the influence of anthropogenic heat was relatively large. The effects of reducing energy consumption, by 50{\%} for hot water supply and 100{\%} for space cooling, on near surface air temperature would be at most -0.5°C.

abstract = {AbstractAlthough there has been considerable research on urban heat island (UHI) effects, most of the previous studies have attributed UHI effects to localized, surface processes. In this study, the impact of upstream urbanization on enhanced UHI effects is examined using surface observations and numerical simulations of an extreme UHI event that occurred on 9 July 2007 over Baltimore, Maryland. Under southwesterly wind, Baltimore experienced higher peak surface temperatures and higher pollution concentrations than did the larger urban area of Washington, D.C. Results from a coupled ultrahigh-resolution mesoscale?urban canopy model with 2001 National Land Cover Data show an advective contribution from upstream urbanization to the UHI event. This dynamical process is demonstrated by replacing Baltimore or its upstream urban areas by natural vegetation (in the model), indicating that the UHI effects could be reduced by as much as 25{\%}. An analysis of the urban?bay interaction reveals the importance of horizontal wind direction in determining the intensity of bay breezes and the urban boundary layer structures. In addition, the vertical growth and structures of UHI effects are shown as layered ?hot plumes? in the mixed layer with pronounced rising motions, and these plumes can be advected many kilometers downstream. These findings suggest that judicious land use and urban planning, especially in rapidly developing countries, could help to alleviate UHI consequences, including heat stress and smog. They also have important implications for improving the prediction of urban weather, including the initiation of moist convection, air quality, and other environment-related problems.},

abstract = {This study investigates the impact of urban form and landscaping type on the mid-afternoon microclimate in semi-arid Phoenix, Arizona. The goal is to find effective urban form and design strategies to ameliorate temperatures during the summer months. We simulated near-ground air temperatures for typical residential neighborhoods in Phoenix using the three-dimensional microclimate model ENVI-met. The model was validated using weather observations from the North Desert Village (NDV) landscape experiment, located on the Arizona State University's Polytechnic campus. The NDV is an ideal site to determine the model's input parameters, since it is a controlled environment recreating three prevailing residential landscape types in the Phoenix metropolitan area (mesic, oasis, and xeric). After validation, we designed five neighborhoods with different urban forms that represent a realistic cross-section of typical residential neighborhoods in Phoenix. The scenarios follow the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification scheme after Stewart and Oke. We then combined the neighborhoods with three landscape designs and, using ENVI-met, simulated microclimate conditions for these neighborhoods for a typical summer day. Results were analyzed in terms of mid-afternoon air temperature distribution and variation, ventilation, surface temperatures, and shading. Findings show that advection is important for the distribution of within-design temperatures and that spatial differences in cooling are strongly related to solar radiation and local shading patterns. In mid-afternoon, dense urban forms can create local cool islands. Our approach suggests that the LCZ concept is useful for planning and design purposes. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Urban climate can have severe impacts on people who use outdoor spaces within a city. In its essence, urban climate is directly linked to the configuration of street axes, building heights and their attributes. Thus, the role of urban planners can be crucial for guaranteeing outdoor thermal comfort and air quality in open spaces. This paper presents observed and estimated relations between urban morphology and changes in microclimate and air quality within a city center. Two approaches are presented, showing results of field measurements and urban climate simulations using the ENVI-met software suite. From measured microclimatic data and comfort surveys, carried out in downtown Curitiba, Brazil, the impact of street geometry on ambient temperatures and on daytime pedestrian comfort levels was evaluated, using the sky-view factor (SVF) as indicator of the complexity of the urban geometry. The impact of street orientation relative to prevailing winds and the resulting effects of ventilation (air speed and spatial distribution) on the dispersion of traffic-generated air pollutants were additionally analyzed by means of computer simulations. Results show the impact of urban geometry on human thermal comfort in pedestrian streets and on the outcomes of pollutant dispersion scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Diurnal temperature range (DTR) is an important climate change index. Its knowledge is important to a range of issues and themes in earth sciences central to urban climatology and human-environment interactions. The present study investigates the effect of urbanization on the land surface temperature (LST) based DTR. This study presents spatial and temporal variations of satellite based estimates of annually averaged DTR over megacity Delhi, the capital of India, which are shown for a period of 11. years during 2001-2011 and analyzes this with regard to its land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) changes and population growth. Delhi which witnessed massive urbanization in terms of population growth (decadal growth rate of Delhi during 2001-2011 was 20.96{\%}) and major transformations in the LU/LC (built-up area crossed more than 53{\%}) are experiencing severity in its micro and macroclimate. There was a consistent increase in the areas experiencing DTR below 11. °C which typically resembled the 'urban class' viz. from 26.4{\%} in the year 2001 to 65.3{\%} in the year 2011 and subsequently the DTR of entire Delhi which was 12.48. °C in the year 2001 gradually reduced to 10.34. °C in the year 2011, exhibiting a significant decreasing trend. Rapidly urbanizing areas like Rohini, Dwarka, Vasant Kunj, Kaushambi, Khanjhawala Village, IIT, Safdarjung Airport, etc. registered a significant decreasing trend in the DTR. In the background of the converging DTR, which was primarily due to the increase in the minimum temperatures, a grim situation in terms of potentially net increase in the heat-related mortality rate especially for the young children below 15. years of age is envisaged for Delhi. Considering the earlier findings that the level of risk of death remained the highest and longest for Delhi, in comparison to megacities like Sao Paulo and London, the study calls for strong and urgent heat island mitigation measures.},

Considering the dependency of the buildings air temperature upon the local urban canopy structure, Tokyo urban canopies were classified in the city-block-scale using the sky-view factor (svf). Then, a multi-scale model system describing the interaction between buildings' energy use and urban meteorological conditions was applied to each classified canopy. In terms of urban warming alleviation and cooling energy saving, simulations suggested that the reduction in the air-conditioning anthropogenic heat could be the most effective measure in office buildings' canopies, and that vegetative fraction increase on the side walls of buildings in residential canopies. Both measures indicated daily and spatially averaged decreases in near-ground summer air temperature of 0.2-1.2 °C. The simulations also suggested these temperature decreases could result in the buildings' cooling energy-savings of 4-40{\%}, indicating remarkable savings in residential canopies. These temperature drops and energy savings tended to increase with the decrease of the svf of urban canopies. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region has experienced a remarkable urbanization during the past 30years, and regional climate change and air pollution are becoming more and more evident due to urbanization. Impacts of urban canopy on regional climate and air quality in dry- and wet-season are investigated in this paper, utilizing the Weather Research and Forecasting/Chemistry (WRF/Chem) model. Four regimes of urban canopy schemes with updated USGS land-use data in actual state of 2004 base on MODIS observations are examined: (1) SLAB scheme that does not consider urban canopy parameters (the control experiment in this paper); (2) a single-layer urban model with a fixed diurnal profile for anthropogenic heat (UCM); (3) multilayer urban canopy model (BEP-Building effect parameterization); (4) multilayer urban models with a building energy model including anthropogenic heat due to air conditioning (BEP+BEM). Results show that, compared with observations, the best 2-m temperature estimates with minimum bias are obtained with SLAB and BEP+BEM schemes, while the best 10-m wind speed predictions are obtained with BEP and BEP+BEM scheme. For PM10and ozone predictions, BEP+BEM scheme predicted PM10well during January, while the best estimate of PM10is obtained with UCM scheme during July, BEP+BEM and SLAB schemes best estimated ozone concentrations for both the two months. Spatial differences of meteorological factors between canopy schemes and control scheme show that compared with SLAB scheme, BEP and BEP+BEM schemes cause an increase of temperature with differences of 0.5°C and 0.3°C, respectively, UCM scheme simulates lower temperature with decrease of 0.7°C during January. In July, all the canopy experiments calculates lower air temperature with reduction of 0.5°C-1.6°C. All the canopy experiments compute lower 10-m wind speed for both January and July. Decreases were 0.7m/s (0.8m/s) with UCM, 1.7m/s (2.6m/s) with BEP, and 1.8m/s (2.3m/s) with BEP+BEM schemes in January (July), respectively. For chemical field distributions, results show that, compared with SLAB scheme, UCM scheme calculates higher PM10concentration in both January and July, with the differences of 22.3{\%} (or 24.4$\mu$g/m3) in January, and 31.4{\%} (or 17.4$\mu$g/m3) in July, respectively. As large as 32.7{\%} (or 18.3 $\mu$g/m3) of PM10increase is found over Hangzhou city during July. While 18.6{\%} (or 22.1 $\mu$g/m3) and 16.7{\%} (or 24.6 $\mu$g/m3) of PM10decreases are fund in BEP and BEP+BEM schemes during January. Compared with control experiment during January, 6.5{\%} (or 2.6ppb) to 10.4{\%} (4.2ppb) increases of ozone are computed over mage-cities by canopy experiments. All the three canopy schemes predict lower ozone concentrations and as large as 30.2{\%} (or 11.2ppb) decrease is obtained with UCM scheme, and 16.5{\%} (6.2ppb) decrease with BEP scheme during July. The SLAB scheme is suitable for real-time weather forecast while multiple urban canopy scheme is necessary when quantify the urbanization impacts on regional climate. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes results from a mesoscale modeling study to quantify the possible meteorological and energy-use impacts of large-scale increases in surface albedo and vegetative fraction. Ten regions in the U.S. were characterized and simulated in base- and modified-surface conditions. Time- and space-dependent meteorological variables were simulated for each region in four 3-day episodes to represent a range of seasonal variations. In terms of peak summer conditions, for example, the mesoscale simulations suggest that at 2 pm local time, urban areas in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington DC, and Philadelphia can be up to 2°C warmer than their rural surrounds, whereas Dallas and Houston can be 1.5°C and Phoenix up to 1°C warmer than rural areas. Miami does not exhibit a significant heat island. The simulations also suggest that large-scale increases in albedo and vegetative fraction can result in spatially-averaged decreases in 2-pm air temperature of 0.5 to 1.5°C during a typical summer day, depending on region. Using a simple interpolative procedure, a complete year of hourly weather data was created for each region (based on episodic meteorological simulation results) and input into energy-use models. The modified weather input was used to assess the effects of large-scale albedo and vegetative fraction changes on annual energy consumption in each of the ten areas targeted in this study. The simulations suggest annual electricity savings of between 1 and 6.7 kWh m-2 (of roof area) in residential neighborhoods and between 2 and 6.1 kWh m-2 in office areas, depending on region. Annual gas penalties amount to up to 34.8 MJ m-2 (of roof area) in residential neighborhoods and up to 21.1 MJ m-2 in office areas.},

abstract = {Abstract The authors combine urban and soil?vegetation surface parameterization schemes with one-dimensional (1D) boundary layer mixing and radiation parameterizations to estimate the maximum impact of increased surface albedo on urban air temperatures. The combined model is evaluated with measurements from an urban neighborhood in Basel, Switzerland, and the importance of surface?atmosphere model coupling is demonstrated. Impacts of extensive albedo increases in two Chicago, Illinois, neighborhoods are modeled. Clear-sky summertime reductions of diurnal maximum air temperature for the residential neighborhood (?p = 0.33) are ?1.1°, ?1.5°, and ?3.6°C for uniform roof albedo increases of 0.19, 0.26, and 0.59, respectively; reductions are about 40{\%} larger for the downtown core (?p = 0.53). Realistic impacts will be smaller because the 1D modeling approach ignores advection; a lake-breeze scenario is modeled and temperature reductions decline by 80{\%}. Assuming no advection, the analysis is extended to seasonal and annual time scales in the residential neighborhood. Yearly average temperature decreases for a 0.59 roof albedo increase are about ?1°C, with summer (winter) reductions about 60{\%} larger (smaller). Annual cooling degree-day decreases are approximately offset by heating degree-day increases and the frequency of very hot days is reduced. Despite the variability of modeling approaches and scenarios in the literature, a consistent range of air temperature sensitivity to albedo is emerging; a 0.10 average increase in neighborhood albedo (a 0.40 roof albedo increase for ?p = 0.25) generates a diurnal maximum air temperature reduction of approximately 0.5°C for ?ideal? conditions, that is, a typical clear-sky midlatitude summer day.},

abstract = {The recent process of urbanisation in the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries (GCCC), including Bahrain, can increase ambient and surface temperatures in newly developed built up areas - the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This study investigates urban expansion in Bahrain over the last few decades and assesses its impact on atmospheric urban heat islands using remote sensing, advanced statistics of weather data and geographical information system (GIS). The study examines how the thermal behaviour of new urban areas is affected by urban elements, with two district models being considered. Numerical modelling is used to assess wind flow, temperatures and heat distribution fluxes within the two models. The assessment shows that mean air temperatures increase within the range of 2. °C-5. °C. The magnitude of the UHI is mainly reinforced by urban activity such as on-going construction processes, shrinkage of green areas and sea reclamation. A comparison of results between the two studied districts reveals that the mean temperature is increased by 2. °C-3. °C in new artificial islands, and by 3. °C-5. °C in deserted urban lands with hot arid conditions. The distribution of urban radiant heat islands is varied and depends largely on the type of land cover and urban surface. Urban grids and structure have a significant impact on the thermal behaviour of newly developed built up areas. Human comfort is improved in the presence of water bodies and green areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Variability of urban fog during the last 50 years in Anhui Province (China) and its possible underlying mechanisms are analyzed based on daily meteorological records from 78 stations. The effects of urban development and aerosols on fog formation are discussed through an analysis of trends in fog frequency and comparison with a number of meteorological parameters, coal consumption and vehicle usage as indicators of economic development and aerosol production, and visibility as an indicator of aerosol load. The impact of urbanization on fog is different at various stages of urban development. The number of annual fog days in most cities studied has increased since the 1960s but decreased after the mid 1980s in large, old cities. New cities, on the other hand, are characterized by still increasing fog frequency. During the last thirty years, fog dissipation time occurred later, average fog duration increased and visibility decreased at most urban stations. The annual total coal combustion of Anhui Province correlates negatively with the average visibility within fog and average annual fog frequency in old cities. The difference in minimum temperature between cities and towns is negatively (positively) correlated with fog frequency in old (new) cities. Our study therefore supports previous findings that the number of fog days in cities is influenced by increased (i) temperatures associated with urban development and (ii) aerosol concentration due to urban development and industrial activity. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study concerns the role of short- and long-wave radiant flux densities from different directions in complex urban settings for human thermal comfort on clear-sky summer days. The aims of the investigation are to quantify the importance of the sky view factor as an urban design-dependent variable for the 3-D radiant flux densities absorbed by the standardized human-biometeorological reference person and to analyze the varying impact of the absorbed 3-D short- and long-wave radiant flux densities on the mean radiant temperature (T-mrt), near-surface air temperature (T-a) and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). The results obtained by measuring campaigns and numerical simulations point to the different importance of the absorbed 3-D radiant flux densities for human thermal comfort characterized by T-a, T-mrt and PET. The magnitude of T-mrt is mainly determined by the total of the absorbed 3-D long-wave radiant flux densities. However, the fluctuations of T-mrt are mainly governed by the total of the absorbed 3-D short- wave radiant flux densities. Their variance can be well explained by the variance of the sky view factor related to the southern part of the upper half space. Taking account of the different impact of the 3-D radiant flux densities, T-mrt can be quite well estimated by a multiple regression using the total of the absorbed 3-D short- wave radiant flux densities and the absorbed long-wave radiant flux density from the lower half space as independent variables. PET can be well estimated by a multiple regression showing T-mrt and T-a as independent variables. On a hot summer day, the increase of the albedo of vertical building walls within a simple E-W oriented street canyon leads to a decrease of the surface temperature of the S-facing wall, but to an increase of T-mrt and PET at the S-facing sidewalk.},

Design: Cross-sectional study conducted in 2017. Setting: Undergraduate classes at the University of Alabama. Participants: A total of 343 undergraduate students, mean age 20.3 years, participated in the study. Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants completed validated instruments measuring Theory of Planned Behavior variables, past behavior, and self-identity. Analysis: Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Overall chi-square goodness of fit, comparative fit index, root mean square error of approximation, and Tucker-Lewis Index were used to assess model fit. Results: Model fit indices showed that the hypothesized structural equation modeling model provided a good fit to the data ($\chi$2= 306.35; degrees of freedom = 104, root mean square error of approximation = 0.08; comparative fit index =0.95; Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.94). Self-identity was the most significant predictor of intention to consume fruits and vegetables, followed by attitude, past behavior, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm among college students. Conclusions and Implications: Nutrition education advocating the role of increased F{\&}V consumption in positive self-identity, such as handouts incorporating images relatable to college students, may increase college students' intention to consume F{\&}V.},

abstract = {Cities impact both local climate, through urban heat islands and global$\backslash$nclimate, because they are an area of heavy greenhouse gas release$\backslash$ninto the atmosphere due to heating, air conditioning and traffic.$\backslash$nIncluding more vegetation into cities is a planning strategy having$\backslash$npossible positive impacts for both concerns. Improving vegetation$\backslash$nrepresentation into urban models will allow us to address more accurately$\backslash$nthese questions. This paper presents an improvement of the Town Energy$\backslash$nBalance (TEB) urban canopy model. Vegetation is directly included$\backslash$ninside the canyon, allowing shadowing of grass by buildings, better$\backslash$nrepresentation of urban canopy form and, a priori, a more accurate$\backslash$nsimulation of canyon air microclimate. The surface exchanges over$\backslash$nvegetation are modelled with the well-known Interaction Soil Biosphere$\backslash$nAtmosphere (ISBA) model that is integrated in the TEB's code architecture$\backslash$nin order to account for interactions between natural and built-up$\backslash$ncovers. The design of the code makes possible to plug and use any$\backslash$nvegetation scheme. Both versions of TEB are confronted to experimental$\backslash$ndata issued from a field campaign conducted in Israel in 2007. Two$\backslash$nsemi-enclosed courtyards arranged with bare soil or watered lawn$\backslash$nwere instrumented to evaluate the impact of landscaping strategies$\backslash$non microclimatic variables and evapotranspiration. For this case$\backslash$nstudy, the new version of the model with integrated vegetation performs$\backslash$nbetter than if vegetation is treated outside the canyon. Surface$\backslash$ntemperatures are closer to the observations, especially at night$\backslash$nwhen radiative trapping is important. The integrated vegetation version$\backslash$nsimulates a more humid air inside the canyon. The microclimatic quantities$\backslash$n(i.e., the street-level meteorological variables) are better simulated$\backslash$nwith this new version. This opens opportunities to study with better$\backslash$naccuracy the urban microclimate, down to the micro (or canyon) scale.},

abstract = {A coupled model consisting of a multilayer urban canopy model and a building energy analysis model has been developed to investigate the diurnal variations of outdoor air temperature in the office areas of Tokyo, Japan. Observations and numerical experiments have been performed for the two office areas in Tokyo. The main results obtained in this study are as follows. The coupled model has accurately simulated the air temperature for a weekday case in which released waste heat has been calculated from the energy consumption and cooling load in the buildings. The model has also simulated the air temperature for a holiday case. However, the waste heat from the buildings has little influence on the outdoor temperatures and can be neglected because of the low working activity in the buildings. The waste heat from the air conditioners has caused a temperature rise of 1°–2°C or more on weekdays in the Tokyo office areas. This heating promotes the heat-island phenomenon in Tokyo on weekdays. Thus, it is shown that the energy consumption process (mainly with air conditioning) in buildings should be included in the modeling of summertime air temperature on weekdays in urban areas.},

abstract = {This study deals with the magnitude of influence of various geographical factors and meteorological variables on the air temperature difference between a park and a built-up area (∆Tu–p). The statistical analysis focuses on the time of nocturnal maximum ∆Tu–p in summer in G{\"{o}}teborg, Swe- den, during May to October 1995. The geographical factors include sky view factor, height above sea level and distance from the park border. The meteorological variables considered include wind, cloud cover and type, global radiation, air temperature, subsurface temperature and humidity. Principal com- ponent analysis is used to identify temporal and spatial patterns of the temperature anomaly along a transect across the built-up area and green area. The first principal loading is found to explain 71{\%} of the total variance. It represents a kind of mean pattern and depicts the dominant distribution of the anomaly along the transect, which is interpreted as being created by the differences in surface charac- teristics. Distance from the park border accounts for 86{\%} of the spatial variation in air temperature. The magnitude of this pattern is mainly modulated by the average wind speed and the average cloud index, i.e. cloud cover and type, from sunset until the time of interest, i.e. 27 and 13{\%} respectively of the vari- ation in ∆Tu–p can be explained by these variables. Subsurface temperature and urban-park vapour pressure difference can explain minor parts of the variation in ∆Tu–p. The wind direction affected both the spatial pattern and the magnitude of ∆Tu–p. The influence on magnitude under different wind directions was probably caused by the difference in relative sizes between the warm built-up area and the colder park and suburban area.},

abstract = {Regional climate change was demonstrated to be likely influenced by anthropogenic dominated land surface processes. Urban heat island (UHI) is one of the important outcomes of such land surface processes induced by urbanization, and it is an urban climate phenomenon influenced by land use pattern and it represents the difference in albedo, roughness, and heat flux exchange of land surface. This study tries to examine the influence of land use change on UHI in greater Guangzhou from 1980-2007 by analysing Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ and MODIS satellite data, meteorological records, and census data. An integrated and modified single-channel method was used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST). Decadal changes in land use fraction and UHI pattern show that cropland decreased in parallel to the increase in built-up area and the correlation coefficient reached 0.97. The UHI effect expanded from urban areas to surrounding suburban areas and countryside with an increase in land surface temperature (mean LST increased by 2.48 from 1990 to 2007) and a decrease in the green vegetation fraction (GVF) (mean GVF decreased by 0.16 from 1990 to 2007). The spatial heterogeneity of UHI expansion can be explained by spatial patterns of economic development, population increase, and abundance of vegetation cover. In addition, remarkable changes in air temperature due to relocation of meteorological stations are significant signals for detecting the influence of urbanization on urban heat island.  2009 Royal Meteorological Society.},

We examined the influence of urban morphology and sea breeze on the microclimate of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Air and surface temperatures, humidity and wind speed were measured at 1 rural and 5 urban sites during the warmest season. The urban sites differed in their height to width (H/W) ratio, ground cover and distance to the sea. Intra-urban air temperature differences were greatest during the daytime. A maximum intra-urban difference of 7 K was recorded on clear days. Maximum temperatures tended to decrease with increasing H/W ratio and proximity to the sea. All urban sites experienced a nocturnal urban heat island (UHI) when the sky was clear or partly cloudy. The temperature differences between sunlit and shaded urban surfaces reached 20 K, which shows the importance of shade in urban canyons (reducing long-wave radiation from surfaces). Within the urban areas, the vapour pressure was high 30 hPa) and showed little diurnal variation. Wind speeds were low 2 m s(-1)) and tended to decrease with increasing H/W ratio. Shading is proposed as the main strategy for lowering air and radiant temperatures; this can be achieved by deeper canyons, covered walkways and shade trees. It is also suggested to open up wind corridors perpendicular to the sea to facilitate deeper sea breeze penetration.},

Here, present and future global inventories of anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) are developed, and parameterizations derived for seasonal and diurnal flux cycles. Equilibrium climate experiments show statistically-significant continental-scale surface warming (0.4 – 0.9°C) produced by one 2100 AHF scenario, but not by current or 2040 estimates. However, significant increases in annual-mean temperature and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height occur over gridcells where present-day AHF exceeds 3.0 W/m2. PBL expansion leads to a slight, but significant increase in atmospheric residence time of aerosols emitted from large- AHF regions. Hence, AHF may influence regional climate projections and contemporary chemistry-climate studies.},

T he urban heat island effect 1 can be detected throughout the year, but it is of particular pub-lic policy concern during the summer, because higher surface air temperature is associated with increases in electricity demand for air conditioning, air pollution, and heat stress-related mortality and illness (Rosenfeld et al. 1995; Nowak et al. 2000; Sailor et al. 2002; Hogrefe et al. 2004). In New York City, New York (NYC), the heat island impacts interact with aging energy and water infrastructure and the anticipated regional effects of global climate change. This has led local decision makers to ask whether heat island mitigation can help to address some of these related urban challenges, for example, by reducing electricity demand for cooling, absorbing stormwater runoff, and reducing the health impacts of heat waves. Our main goal was to compare the possible effectiveness of heat island mitigation strategies to increase urban vegetation, such as planting trees or incorporating vegetation into rooftops, with strategies to increase the albedo of impervious surfaces. The specific stakeholder question guiding our research was the following: can heat island mitigation strate-gies reduce peak electricity demand in neighbor-hoods with potential electric distribution constraints 1 Urbanization is often associated with elevated surface air temperature, a condition referred to as the urban heat island.

When the environment was stably stratified with a buoyancy frequency N (nocturnal UHIs) and the sea breeze was absent, the UHI circulation was mainly governed by the Froude number [Fr = U/(ND)], in agreement with theoretical predictions found in literature (U was the horizontal velocity scale of the flow based on H0 and D). Furthermore, the results were in agreement with other laboratory studies and with nighttime field observations conducted in large cities. It was found that U, when calculated with H0 + HL (where HL was the surface heat flux associated with the land temperature growth occurring after sunrise), could also be employed as the velocity scale for UHI circulations that develop in statically unstable environment...},

The energy performance evaluation showed a significant reduction of the building's cooling load during summer. This reduction varied for the whole building in the range of 6-49{\%} and for its last floor in the range of 12-87{\%}. Moreover, the influence of the green roof system in the building's heating load was found insignificant, and this can be regarded a great advantage of the system as any interference in the building shell for the reduction of cooling load leads usually to the increase of its heating load. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Urban heat island effect refers to the phenomenon that ambient air and surface temperatures in urban areas are several degrees higher than surrounding rural areas. Higher temperatures not only impact the comfort of urban dwellers, but also increase energy use, ozone production, and the risk of death for humans in a heat wave. Our research focuses on the variation in land surface temperature in the Gywnns Fall Watershed, Maryland. We found that land surface temperature is highly variable spatially, resulting in "hotspots" within the heat island. We further explore how this temperature variation relates to social factors on the scale of the census-based block group. We show that land surface temperature is statistically higher in block groups that are characterized by low income, high poverty, less education, more ethnic minorities, more elderly people and greater risk of crime. These variables were mapped to evaluate the spatial relationship of land surface temperatures to social factors. This spatially explicit approach facilitates identification of specific areas to prioritize for heat prevention and intervention efforts. We demonstrate, through an exercise, how incorporating data on land surface temperature and social factors into heat intervention strategies could contribute to efficient allocation of limited resources and services. The exercise also indicates where heat prevention efforts, such as tree-planting programs, are most needed to help reduce heat exposure and moderate the urban heat island effect. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In western societies, the combined effects of climate warming, proceeding urbanization, and demographic change (e.g. population aging) increase the risk of city populations to be subjected to heat-related stress. To provide a scientific fundament for city-wide and spatially explicit adaptation planning, urban heat distribution and the population at risk need to be studied at small spatial scale. This study pursued to (a) investigate the land surface temperature (LST) distribution with regard to underlying effects of urban land use patterns, and to (b) identify areas at potential risk towards heat stress based on temperatures distribution and demographic vulnerability. We used LST maps as derived from two Landsat thermal satellite images for 10. pm and 10. am at two subsequent summer days and examined land use patterns through land use types, landscape metrics, and structural parameters via statistical and GIS analysis. Using linear regressions we obtained the degree of soil sealing to be the best predictor of LST-variations. However, under certain conditions, NDVI, distance to city center and floor area ratio (FAR) were better predictors. Water bodies had beneficial effects at 10. am and inverse effects at 10. pm, vice versa for arable land. The cooling effects of green areas were more significant in the morning than in the evening. Residential uses were among the most heat affected land use types at 10. pm, with different intensities according to their density level. For the identification of risk areas at the building scale, we introduced a matrix to combine simulated air temperature with population age and density. Results showed higher potential risk in central inner-city areas of dense residential uses, in particular for areas with high amounts of elderly residents, and for two major residential building types. The identified building blocks of specific heat stress risk provide urban planners with useful information to mitigate adverse effects caused by future heat waves. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The dynamics of atmospheric parameters (e.g., the wind velocity and temperature profiles, height of various layers, etc.) associated with the interaction processes of mountain-valley circulation and urban heat island is followed. The observations are carried out using lidars (aerosol and Raman), kytoon (tethered balloon) and pilot balloons over the city of Sofia (42°39'N, 23°23' E, 591m above MSL) and cover heights from 70 to 900m. The presence of neighboring mountains and the urban heat island effect lead to the formation of three temperature inversions (ground, elevated and capping) and specific vertical profiles of the wind velocity. The formation mechanism is considered of two-layer aerosol structure in the atmosphere over the urban area and its dynamics observed by the lidar after sunset. The results obtained are compared with a model developed on the basis of common models: one describing nocturnal boundary layer development within a mountain valley and the other dealing with stable stratification formation in the case of urban area situated on plain terrain. {\textcopyright} 2000.},

abstract = {While satellite images effectively show surface urban heat islands in urbanized areas, linking surface temperatures to actual ambient temperatures remains a research challenge. Microclimates in urbanized settings can vary tremendously in very short distances, making adequate climate interpolations across a large metropolitan area difficult, at best. This study links the coarse scale of satellite (ASTER) images to the fine scale of hand-held thermography as part of an in-depth suburban neighborhood climate study to determine if ASTER imaging can be used to adequately estimate neighborhood climate conditions in an urbanized area. The study utilizes day and night remotely-sensed and ground data from June, 2004 for Phoenix, Arizona. Microclimate conditions of three urban fringe neighborhoods with varying amounts of natural vegetation and development density were studied, along with ASTER remote sensing data, mobile climate transects, and spot infrared thermographic images. These neighborhoods, though variable, showed only minor differences, and the study indicates that daytime images (11:20 am) do not adequately rank observed conditions within these neighborhoods - the highest ASTER surface temperatures were recorded for the least-dense neighborhood with a natural desert landscaping, though lowest ambient temperatures were measured there. Daytime mean surface temperatures versus air temperatures were 50.4 °C (30.8 °C air temp); 53.5 °C (29.7 °C); and 50.6 °C (31.9 °C). It was found that nighttime (10:40 pm LST) differences among neighborhoods of surface and air temperatures were relatively consistent, with the most densely developed neighborhood having the highest ASTER surface temperatures (29.0 °C) and transect-derived air temperatures (30.0 °C). Issues of view angle, shadowing, emissivity, resolution, and wind conditions for daytime results with their relatively small mean differences observed across the neighborhoods may explain why the rank of ASTER thermal conditions versus observed ambient conditions was poor. However, following sunset, these issues of view angle, etc., are much less problematic. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A recent re-evaluation of urban heat island (UHI) studies has suggested that the urban effect may be expressed more meaningfully as a difference between Local Climate Zones (LCZ), defined as areas with characteristic dimensions of between one and several kilometers that have distinct effects on climate at both micro-and local-scales (city streets to neighborhoods), rather than adopting the traditional method of comparing urban and rural air temperatures. This paper reports on a UHI study in Dublin (Ireland) which maps the urban area into LCZ and uses these as a basis for carrying out a UHI study. The LCZ map for Dublin is derived using a widely available land use/cover map as a basis. A small network of in-situ stations is deployed into different LCZ across Dublin and additional mobile temperature traverses carried out to examine the thermal characteristics of LCZ following mixed weather during a 1 week period in August 2010. The results show LCZ with high impervious/building coverage were on average {\textgreater}4 °C warmer at night than $\backslash$r$\backslash$nLCZ with high pervious/vegetated coverage during conditions conducive to strong UHI development. The distinction in mean LCZ nocturnal temperature allows for the generation of a heat map across the entire urban area.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a computational study on the energy consumption and related CO2emissions for heating and cooling of an office building within the Urban Heat Island of London, currently and in the future. The study developed twenty weather files in an East-West axis through London; the weather files were constructed according to future climate change scenario for 2050 suitable for the UK which have been modified to represent specific locations within the London UHI based on measurements and predictions from a program developed for this purpose (LSSAT). The study simulated an office with typical construction, heat gains and operational patterns with an advanced thermal simulation program (IESVE). The predictions confirm that heating load decreases, cooling load and overheating hours increase as the office location moves from rural to urban sites and from present to future years. It is shown that internal heat gains are an important factor affecting energy performance and that night cooling using natural ventilation will have a beneficial effect at rural and city locations. As overheating will increase in the future, more buildings will use cooling; it is shown that this might lead to a five-fold increase of CO2emission for city centre offices in London in 2050. The paper presents detailed results of the typical office placed on the East-West axis of the city, arguing the necessity to consider using weather files based on climate projections and urban heat island for the design of current buildings to safeguard their efficiency in the future. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Values for Hamburg's synoptic site HH-Fuhlsb{\"{u}}ttel start in 1891 and are used to determine climate changes. Additional data from up to 45 climate stations are used to analyze the different aspects of the regional climate and urban effects on the temperature urban heat island (UHI) and precipitation urban precipitation impact (UPI). The analysis of the long-term data shows that the climate has already changed. Annual precipitation significantly increases sim0.8 mm/year when focusing on years 1891-2007 and sim1.3 mm/year for 1948-2007. Precipitation increases are largest in November through March and March as well as June for 1978-2007. For April and July of this period, a precipitation decrease is found. The precipitation distribution shows that moderate daily precipitation amounts (le10 mm/day) have increased by about 10{\%} between 1948-1977 and 1978-2007. Precipitation amounts {\textgreater} 10 mm/day have increased by 20{\%} in the same period. Average temperatures significantly increase by 0.07 K/decade (1891-2007), 0.19 K/decade (1948-2007), 0.6 K/decade (1978-2007) with largest significant increases in fall. For the UHI, it is found that the average temperature is higher up to 1.1 K in the densely build-up city area than outside. Values are about halved for more green urban areas but also depend on more local impacts. The minimum temperatures are up to 3 K higher and maximum temperatures slightly lower in the inner city than in the rural during summer. The winter temperatures are higher throughout the urban area. The UHI differences depend on wind speed; this dependence is best described by using the inverse square root of the wind speed. Classification using different wind directions shows that the precipitation is significantly higher (5-20{\%}) for downwind of urban areas compared with the upwind side.

abstract = {Large-scale tree planting programs have been proposed, and are being implemented, as a means of reducing energy demand, mitigating urban heat islands, and improving air quality. However, many species of trees emit highly photochemically reactive hydrocarbons and the rates of such emissions can vary by four orders of magnitude, depending upon the tree species. Thus, planting of high-emitting trees species on a massive scale has the potential to adversely affect air quality rather than leading to improvement. However, the selection of low-emitting trees is difficult because emission rates have been experimentally determined for only a limited number of species. The present study describes a methodology for assigning biogenic emission rates based on taxonomic relationships. Using this methodology, direct emission measurements from 124 tree and shrub species found in the California South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) are used to assign emission rates to 253 other species found in the SoCAB but for which there are no measured emission rates. The combined listing of 377 species is ranked according to total (isoprene and monoterpenes) biogenic emission rate on an hourly basis. Although the ranking of trees developed here is specific to Southern California, the methodology described can be applied to other geographic areas to assist in the planting of low-emitting urban forests.},

abstract = {Since the mid-20th century, most large cities of the United States have been warming at more than twice the rate of the planet as a whole. While many municipal and state governments have developed climate action plans designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases typically are not the strongest driver of warming in cities. Our purpose is to evaluate the likely effectiveness of municipal and state level climate action plans in slowing the pace of warming in the most populous U.S. cities over the near-to-medium term. We employ time-series temperature trend analyses to differentiate global from local-scale climate change mechanisms in large U.S. cities between 1961 and 2010. We then review all climate action plans developed at the municipal or state level in the 50 most populous metropolitan regions to identify the various emissions control and heat management strategies incorporated into these plans. The results of our assessment suggest that the climate change management policies adopted through municipal and state climate action plans may fail to adequately protect human health and welfare from rapidly rising temperatures. Based on our review, we recommend that municipal and state governments broaden climate action plans to include heat management strategies in addition to greenhouse gas emissions controls. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The results revealed an overriding importance of urban land cover expansion in the changes in heat island intensity and surface temperature patterns. Urban development was also related to a continual air temperature increase in the 1980s and 1990s. The combined use of satellite-derived vegetation and land cover distributions with land surface temperature maps provides a potential useful tool for many planning applications.

abstract = {Tucson, Arizona, is an example of the many cities in the southwestern United States experiencing rapid growth and urban sprawl over the last several decades. The accompanying extensive modification of land use and land cover leads to many environmental impacts, including urban heat islands. The primary aim of this paper is to expand knowledge of the phenomenon for Tucson, by quantifying the amount of urban warming, and by mapping temperature patterns over the city and examining related aspects of the local-scale atmospheric circulation. The secondary aim is to document how an applied empirical research project was integrated into an introductory undergraduate climatology class via active learning. The paper begins and concludes with general and practical comments on combining the research and educational aspects of the project. An analysis of 30-yr temporal trends in urban and nonurban minimum temperatures across the region shows the rate of urban warming to be about three-quarters of the general regional warming. Tucson's urban heat island is similar to 3 degrees C over the last century, with {\textgreater}2 degrees C of this warming in the last 30 years. The annual average urban warming trend over the last three decades is 0.071 degrees C yr(-1) with the strongest effect in March and the weakest effect in November. There is evidence that the latter is caused by strong, near-surface winds under stable conditions. A case study is presented comprising field measurements and map analysis of urban temperatures and supporting variables for 13 February 1999. Measurements include comprehensive mapping using vehicle-mounted thermistors and numerous local meteorological observations from around the city. Wind speeds during the field measurements were somewhat stronger than is typical of heat island studies, up to 12 m s(-1). Nonetheless, because of terrain-induced Rows and land surface heterogeneity, complex temperature patterns were observed. Several transient katabatic flows off surrounding mountain ranges were detected, leading to localized cold pockets. Locally warm areas in other parts of the city are associated with terrain sheltering or local land surface heating. The central city showed a possible urban heating pattern with temperatures similar to 2 degrees C higher than upwind rural air.},

abstract = {Air temperature is an essential component in microclimate and environmental health research, but difficult to map in urban environments because of strong temperature gradients. We introduce a spatial regression approach to map the peak daytime air temperature relative to a reference station on typical hot summer days using Vancouver, Canada as a case study. Three regression models, ordinary least squares regression, support vector machine, and random forest, were all calibrated using Landsat TM/ETM. + data and field observations from two sources: Environment Canada and the Weather Underground. Results based on cross-validation indicate that the random forest model produced the lowest prediction errors (RMSE. = 2.31. °C). Some weather stations were consistently cooler/hotter than the reference station and were predicted well, while other stations, particularly those close to the ocean, showed greater temperature variability and were predicted with greater errors. A few stations, most of which were from the Weather Underground data set, were very poorly predicted and possibly unrepresentative of air temperature in the area. The random forest model generally produced a sensible map of temperature distribution in the area. The spatial regression approach appears useful for mapping intra-urban air temperature variability and can easily be applied to other cities. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The growth of the cities is characterized by a great increase in built and paved areas, energy use and heat generation. The phenomenon of urban warming is called heat island. Heat islands cause not only thermal discomfort. High temperatures are responsible for the increase of energy demand for air conditioning in buildings and photochemistry effects that increase atmospheric pollution, as well as increasing environmental impacts due to the demand of energy generation. Materials with high albedo and emittance attain lower temperatures when exposed to solar radiation, reducing the transference of heat to the environmental air. This paper focuses on presenting the results of the measurement of albedo of materials used for building roofs in Brazil, using a spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere accessory, and evaluating the heat gain on roofs, by calculating the surface temperature that each material can reach when exposed to solar radiation. Albedo is defined as the specular and diffuse reflectance integrated over the 290 and 2500 nm wavelength range, which corresponds to approximately 96{\%} of the solar radiation that reaches the earth's surface. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In the summer of 2002, measurements were simultaneously performed to investigate the characteristics of heat flow in urban areas at three locations in Kyoto city: (1) a commercial urban area mixed with low-rise traditional residential buildings that represents the urban area of Kyoto; (2) a university campus area with lots of green zones; and (3) a plaza covered with a concrete slab which was used as a reference point of measurement. Heat flux of boundary layer over the three locations and the surface temperatures of building walls and streets were measured to investigate the urban thermal environment. For the analysis, a new simulation code was developed by combining unsteady state heat conduction of building walls and grounds, radiation heat exchange between them, and airflow by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). By using this code, the thermal environment of the urban areas such as air temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and boundary layer heat flux was predicted and compared with the measured results. It was found that this model could predict the real thermal environment of the urban area. Using this code, the effect of additional green on roofs and grounds can be investigated in order to mitigate urban heat island and to improve urban thermal environment at the street level. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A fine-resolution, meso-urban meteorological model was updated and applied, using new data and techniques in this study, in driving fine-resolution photochemical simulations to evaluate the air-quality impacts of urban heat island mitigation. The drag-force-based formulation of the model improves the simulation of fine-resolution meteorological and air-pollutant concentration fields in the urban canopy layer. Compared to the meso scale, the meso-urban modeling of heat island mitigation produces larger localized impacts on meteorology and ozone air quality and captures phenomena of interest that are typically not detectable at the coarser scale. These include, for example, cool islands, heat islands, flow convergence associated with heat island circulation, flow divergence at the leading edge of urban areas, and vertical variation in turbulent kinetic energy budget components within the canopy layer in response to vertical changes in densities of buildings and vegetation. They also include fine-resolution features in the simulated ozone concentration field and its response to surface modifications. Model results show that heat island mitigation is effective in reducing local ozone concentrations. This paper presents results from Sacramento, California, as an example using increased urban albedo as the control mechanism. For the region, episodic conditions, and surface modification scenarios examined in this paper, air temperature is decreased by up to 3 °C. Changes in ozone consist overwhelmingly of decreases but can also involve increases with the latter being confined to small areas and short time intervals. While larger reductions in ozone are detected, decreases of up to 5-10 ppb are more representative and the daily maximum 8-h average can be decreased by up to 13{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Urban shade trees and light-colored surfaces can offset or reverse the heat island and conserve energy. Implementation of heat island mitigation measures is now a prominent part of President Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan to control the emissions of greenhouse gases, necessitating a better understanding of the quantitative benefits of these control measures. We present recent measurements of the air-conditioning savings for houses in Sacramento and Florida, and air temperature measurements at White Sands National Monument, New Mexico. We also discuss the results of meteorological and smog simulations for the Los Angeles Basin. The albedo of a city may be increased gradually if high-albedo surfaces are chosen to replace darker materials during routine maintenance of roofs and roads. Such high-albedo surfaces may last longer than their conventional dark counterparts. Utility-sponsored incentive programs, product labeling, and standards could promote the use of high-albedo materials for buildings and roads, and several paint manufacturers have expressed interest in participating in a 'cool surfaces' labeling program. We examine the spectral reflectance of various white coatings and building materials that might be labeled in such a program. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {The Yangtze River Delta Economic Belt is one of the most active and developed areas in China and has experienced quick urbanization with fast economic development. The weather research and forecasting model (WRF), with a single-layer urban canopy parameterization scheme, is used to simulate the influence of urbanization on climate at local and regional scales in this area. The months January and July, over a 5-year period (2003-2007), were selected to represent the winter and summer climate. Two simulation scenarios were designed to investigate the impacts of urbanization: (1) no urban areas and (2) urban land cover determined by MODIS satellite observations in 2005. Simulated near-surface temperature, wind speed and specific humidity agree well with the corresponding measurements. By comparing the simulations of the two scenarios, differences in near-surface temperature, wind speed and precipitation were quantified. The conversion of rural land (mostly irrigation cropland) to urban land cover results in significant changes to near-surface temperature, humidity, wind speed and precipitation. The mean near-surface temperature in urbanized areas increases on average by 0.45 ± 0.43°C in winter and 1.9 ± 0.55°C in summer; the diurnal temperature range in urbanized areas decreases on average by 0.13 ± 0.73°C in winter and 0.55 ± 0.84°C in summer. Precipitation increases about 15{\%} over urban or leeward areas in summer and changes slightly in winter. The urbanization impact in summer is stronger and covers a larger area than that in winter due to the regional east-Asian monsoon climate characterized by warm, wet summers and cool, dry winters. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Waste heat released from human activities (anthropogenic heating) can be a significant contributor to the urban energy balance, and can thus play an important role in affecting the urban thermal environment, ambient air quality, and other attributes of the urban climate system. To quantify the impacts of anthropogenic heating we have incorporated it as a source term in the near-surface energy balance within the MM5 mesoscale atmospheric model. This energy balance is calculated as part of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) module within the MM5. Because of the multiple PBL scheme options available within the MM5 and other atmospheric modeling systems we have enabled anthropogenic heating within two commonly used PBL modules - Blackadar (BL) and Gayno-Seaman (GS). Results from a case study series of simulations for Philadelphia suggest that anthropogenic heating plays an important role in the formation of the urban heat island, particularly during the night and winter. Control simulations (without anthropogenic heating) consistently underestimated urban air temperatures and the observed urban heat island effect. Simulations for winter suggest that anthropogenic heating contributes 2-3°C to the nighttime heat island. In addition, anthropogenic heating is also found to have impacts on the nocturnal PBL stability and PBL structure during the morning transition. The choice of PBL scheme affects the magnitude of these modeled impacts. In winter, for example, the addition of anthropogenic heating in the BL scheme resulted in a 3°C temperature increase at night compared with about a 2°C temperature increase in the corresponding GS simulation. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Due to the combination of rapid global urbanization and climate change, urban climate issues are becoming relatively more important and are gaining interest. Compared to rural areas, the temperature in cities is higher (the urban heat island effect) due to themodifications in the surface radiation and energy balances.This study hypothesizes that the urban heat island can be mitigated by introducing open surface water in urban design. In order to test this, we use theWRFmesoscalemeteorologicalmodel in which an idealized circular city is designed. Herein, the surface water cover, its size, spatial configuration, and temperature are varied. Model results indicate that the cooling effect of water bodies depends nonlinearly on the fractional water cover, size, and distribution of individual lakeswithin the citywith respect to wind direction. Relatively large lakes show a high temperature effect close to their edges and in downwind areas. Several smaller lakes equally distributed within the urban area have a smaller temperature effect, but influence a larger area of the city. Evaporation fromopenwater bodies may lower the temperature, but on the other hand also increases the humidity, which dampens the positive effect on thermal comfort. In addition,when the water iswarmer than the air temperature (during autumn or night), the water body has an adverse effect on thermal comfort. In those cases, the water body eventually limits the cooling and thermal comfort in the surrounding city, and thus diverges from the original intention of the intervention. Citation:},

abstract = {Urbanization related alterations to the surface energy balance impact urban warming ('heat islands'), the growth of the boundary layer, and many other biophysical processes. Traditionally, in situ heat flux measures have been used to quantify such processes, but these typically represent only a small local-scale area within the heterogeneous urban environment. For this reason, remote sensing approaches are very attractive for elucidating more spatially representative information. Here we use hyperspectral imagery from a new airborne sensor, the Operative Modular Imaging Spectrometer (OMIS), along with a survey map and meteorological data, to derive the land cover information and surface parameters required to map spatial variations in turbulent sensible heat flux (QH). The results from two spatially-explicit flux retrieval methods which use contrasting approaches and, to a large degree, different input data are compared for a central urban area of Shanghai, China: (1) the Local-scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme (LUMPS) and (2) an Aerodynamic Resistance Method (ARM). Sensible heat fluxes are determined at the full 6 m spatial resolution of the OMIS sensor, and at lower resolutions via pixel aggregation and spatial averaging. At the 6 m spatial resolution, the sensible heat flux of rooftop dominated pixels exceeds that of roads, water and vegetated areas, with values peaking at ∼ 350 W m- 2, whilst the storage heat flux is greatest for road dominated pixels (peaking at around 420 W m- 2). We investigate the use of both OMIS-derived land surface temperatures made using a Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) approach, and land surface temperatures estimated from air temperature measures. Sensible heat flux differences from the two approaches over the entire 2 × 2 km study area are less than 30 W m- 2, suggesting that methods employing either strategy maybe practica1 when operated using low spatial resolution (e.g. 1 km) data. Due to the differing methodologies, direct comparisons between results obtained with the LUMPS and ARM methods are most sensibly made at reduced spatial scales. At 30 m spatial resolution, both approaches produce similar results, with the smallest difference being less than 15 W m- 2in mean QHaveraged over the entire study area. This is encouraging given the differing architecture and data requirements of the LUMPS and ARM methods. Furthermore, in terms of mean study QH, the results obtained by averaging the original 6 m spatial resolution LUMPS-derived QHvalues to 30 and 90 m spatial resolution are within ∼ 5 W m- 2of those derived from averaging the original surface parameter maps prior to input into LUMPS, suggesting that that use of much lower spatial resolution spaceborne imagery data, for example from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is likely to be a practical solution for heat flux determination in urban areas.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess variations in indoor temperatures in London dwellings during periods of hot weather, and the degree to which those dwelling-to-dwelling variations are explained by the thermal characteristics of the dwelling and location within the urban heat island (UHI).Indoor temperatures during periods of hot weather were modelled using the EnergyPlus simulation programme, taking as input data the building characteristics of 15 notional dwelling archetypes broadly representative of the London housing stock, and assessed under warm future weather conditions at two locations within London. Data on dwelling types and characteristics were determined from Geographic Information System databases, national level domestic building surveys and other sources. External weather data were derived from the London Site-Specific Air Temperature model under the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) 2002 2050s Medium-High emissions scenario.There was substantial variation in indoor temperatures across built forms. The thermal quality of a dwelling has an appreciably greater effect on indoor temperatures during the 'hot' period studied than the UHI itself.The effects of built form and other dwelling characteristics appear to be more important determinants of variation in high indoor temperatures than the location of a dwelling within London's UHI. This observation suggests that policies aimed at protection against the adverse effects of high summer temperatures may need to focus more on dwelling design and construction than on the amelioration of the UHI. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Large spatial variations exist in heat flux on both a land-use scale and the urban scale. Arguments based upon empirical data and sampling theory show that estimates of heat flux representative of an upwind fetch I, require a minimum observation height proportional to z3j4. The influence of advection on the magnitude of the heat flux is also explored for both the urban and sub-urban or land-use scales. The data clearly indicate that advection can strongly modulate and even dominate the vertical heat flux above surfaces in areas which maintain large horizontal temperature gradients. The advection contribution is positive for cold air advection and negative for warm air advection, and may result from either the urban heat island or land-use mesoscale features. The depth of advective influence is directly proportional to the horizontal scale of the phenomenon and inversely proportional to horizontal temperature gradient.},

abstract = {In this paper, Shanghai city, the biggest city in China, was selected as the case for quantifying the impact of land-use/land cover (LULC) change on patterns of surface urban heat island (UHI). Time series of LULC maps of Shanghai were produced from Landsat TM/ETM+ images between 1997 and 2008, during which this city experienced unprecedented urban growth. The results show that dramatic changes in LULC have occurred, with loss of cropland, forest and shrub to urban use. The built-up land increased by 219.50{\%}. In contrast, bare land, cropland, fallow land, forest and shrub decreased by 79.38{\%}, 50.50{\%}, 43.35{\%}, and 20.90{\%}, respectively. Consequently, these drastically altered the land surface characteristics and spatiotemporal patterns of UHI. According to temporal analysis on seasonal and inter-annual variations of intensity of the UHI (UHII), both the mean UHII between the city center (UHIIC-R) and UHII between the peri-urban and surrounding rural areas (UHIIP-R) reached maximum during summer period, followed by UHIIC-Rand UHIIP-Rduring spring period. UHIIC-Rand UHIIP-Rwere both relatively weak during winter period. In contrast, UHIIC-R and UHIIP-R were both slight during autumn period. Spatially, there were significant LSTs gradients from the city center to surrounding rural areas. Furthermore, the overall relationships between surface UHI pattern and pixel-based biophysical features as well as population density and road density were quantitatively explored. Thus, based on temporal-spatial analysis of land use dynamics, patterns of LST, and socioeconomic driving forces, our findings highlight the urgent demands for planers and decision-makers to deliberately take urban expansion, UHI effects, and their impact on local climate change into account in future planning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The role of urban green areas in the microclimatic conditions of cities, during summer, is investigated in this paper through monitoring campaigns carried out at the National garden, at the city centre of Athens. Two types of investigations were carried out: i) a microscopic one that investigated the thermal conditions inside the Garden and the immediate surrounding urban area and ii) a macroscopic one that compared the temperature profile of the Garden with that of the greater city centre area. It was concluded that in microscopic level, the temperature profile inside the National Garden and the immediate surrounding urban area did not showed a clear evidence of the influence of the Garden and it was dependent on the characteristics of each location. In a macroscopic scale, the Garden was found cooler than the other monitored urban locations and temperature differences were mainly greater during the night, especially in streets with high building height to street width (H/W) ratio and low traffic, while in streets with high anthropogenic heat during the day, the biggest temperature differences were recorded during the day.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between climate and the energy sector. In particular, we primarily discuss empirical papers published in peer-reviewed economics journals focusing on how climate affects energy expenditures and consumption. Climate will affect energy consumption by changing how consumers respond to short run weather shocks (the intensive margin) as well as how people will adapt in the long run (the extensive margin). Along the intensive margin, further research that uses household and firm-level panel data of energy consumption may help identify how energy consumers around the world respond to weather shocks. Research on technology adoption, e.g. air conditioners, will further our understanding of the extensive margin adjustments and their costs. We also note that most of the literature focuses on the residential sector. Similar studies are urgently needed for the industrial and commercial sectors.},

abstract = {Using the Atlanta metropolitan area as a case study, we examine the effects of urbanization and its associated heat island on urban ozone concentrations. Air quality data from Atlanta suggest that urban ozone concentrations are enhanced by increases in ambient temperature. Model calculations suggest that this enhancement is caused by the effect of temperature on the atmospheric chemistry of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), as well as the temperature dependence of natural and anthropogenic hydrocarbon emissions. A comparison of summertime temperatures in Atlanta and a nearby rural station, suggests that Atlanta's temperature over the past 15 years has increased by about 2°C due to urbanization and its concomitant intensification of the urban heat island. Numerical simulations using conditions of a typical summertime day in Atlanta suggest that this rise in temperature could have, (1.) resulted in a significant increase in the net emissions of natural hydrocarbons in the area in spite of the loss of about 20{\%} of the area's forests over the same period, and (2.) negated the beneficial effects on summertime ozone concentrations that would have been obtained from a 50{\%} reduction in anthropogenic hydrocarbon emissions. Because a NOx-based ozone abatement strategy appears to be less sensitive to temperature increases than does a hydrocarbon-based strategy, a NOx strategy may prove to be more effective in the future if temperatures continue to rise as a result of urbanization and the “greenhouse effect”.},

abstract = {Near surface climate was observed through temperature profiling from the surface to 2.47m height in an urban vegetated park and its surroundings in central Stockholm, Sweden. Measurements were conducted during three sum- mer days by mobile traverses. Air temperature differences between the built-up area and the park were in the range of 0.5–0.8 ?C during the day and reached a maximum of 2 ?C at sunset. The thermal stratification of the air was mainly stable in the park and unstable in the built-up area. Inverse air temperature profiles in the park were less stable in open than in shady areas, and close to neutral at midday. The most unstable air was found in the north–south orientated canyons in the early afternoon. Possible heat advection from the surroundings, and thus uncoupling between the surface and the air, was identified through temperature gradients pointing at different directions within the 2.47m profile. Examples at midday indicated that warm air advected as far as 150m into the park. 1.},

abstract = {In this paper, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, coupled to the Urban Canopy Model, is employed to simulate the impact of urbanization on the regional climate over three vast city agglomerations in China. Based on high-resolution land use and land cover data, two scenarios are designed to represent the nonurban and current urban land use distributions. By comparing the results of two nested, high-resolution numerical experiments, the spatial and temporal changes on surface air temperature, heat stress index, surface energy budget, and precipitation due to urbanization are analyzed and quantified. Urban expansion increases the surface air temperature in urban areas by about 1 degrees C, and this climatic forcing of urbanization on temperature is more pronounced in summer and nighttime than other seasons and daytime. The heat stress intensity, which reflects the combined effects of temperature and humidity, is enhanced by about 0.5 units in urban areas. The regional incoming solar radiation increases after urban expansion, which may be caused by the reduction of cloud fraction. The increased temperature and roughness of the urban surface lead to enhanced convergence. Meanwhile, the planetary boundary layer is deepened, and water vapor is mixed more evenly in the lower atmosphere. The deficit of water vapor leads to less convective available potential energy and more convective inhibition energy. Finally, these combined effects may reduce the rainfall amount over urban areas, mainly in summer, and change the regional precipitation pattern to a certain extent.},

The aim of this paper is to summarise several attempts carried out in the last decade to interpolate nocturnal air temperatures across Lisbon, in order to be able to draw thermal maps as accurately as possible. This study refers only to clear nights. Stepwise multiple regression and a Geographic Information System were used to model the relation between air temperature and parameters related to land-use and topography. The different regression models (coefficients of determination between 0.68 and 0.92) show that canopy layer air temperature depends on sky-view factor, building height and percentage of built-up area, but also to a great extend on mesoclimatic geographic factors such as altitude, topography and distance from the Tagus River. Examples of four frequently encountered nocturnal air temperature patterns are presented, each corresponds to a different weather type. This method employed could prove useful in drawing climatic maps that may be of use in master plans of urban municipalities.},

abstract = {The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) was used along with the PSU/NCAR mesoscale modeling system MM5 to study air quality modeling sensitivity to various planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes implemented in MM5. Two 37-day periods, representing typical summer and winter periods, were selected for the simulations. The MM5 domain covered the continental US while the CMAQ domain covered much of the central and eastern US. There were 34 vertical layers in MM5 and 18 in CMAQ. The horizontal resolution was 36 km for both. MM5 was run with five of the seven commonly used PBL schemes to generate a series of gridded meteorological fields. The data were then processed and converted by the meteorology-chemistry interface processor (MCIP) to produce meteorological input for CMAQ, in conjunction with the emissions data prepared by the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) System. The sensitivity of MM5-CMAQ modeling to the various PBL schemes was assessed and quantified by comparing model output against observations from the meteorological and the air quality monitoring networks within the CMAQ domain. The meteorological variables evaluated included surface (2-m) and 850-mb temperature, 10-meter and 850 mb wind speed and direction, 2-m mixing ratio, surface pressure, and cloud fraction over 50 surface sites and 21 upper air sounding sites. The CMAQ variables included gaseous species O3, NO2, NOx, SO2and fine particulate matter PM2.5for over 2000 monitoring stations. A new 3-2-1 objective evaluation approach was developed to enhance the model sensitivity analysis. Results of evaluation of these variables indicate that domain-wide the performance of neither model was sensitive to the PBL schemes. Although large differences of PBL height existed across the meteorological simulations, they did not appreciably affect the CMAQ performance. On an urban scale, differences across the CMAQ simulations were large enough for the model to be considered sensitive, although no favorable PBL scheme was identified. It is suggested that domain-wide the lack of sensitivity of the MM5-CMAQ modeling system to the PBL schemes was mainly attributed to the parameterization of vertical eddy diffusivity in CMAQ and the four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) in MM5. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show a coupling effect of Urban Heat Island Circulation (UHIC), Mountain Valley Breeze (MVB) and Sea Land Breeze (SLB) occurs in this area when the synoptic system is weak. The SLB can penetrate deep into the mainland for about 200 km when it is blooming. MVB can extend to south and cover almost the whole plain area in Beijing. Both MVB and SLB are diurnal periodical; meanwhile the phase of MVB drops behind that of SLB for about six hours. As a local circulation, the UHIC weakens the two circulations above, and it also has a diurnal period. As a result, the coupling effect of circulations reveals not only different features in spring-summer period and autumn-winter period in a year but also the difference between early morning to noonday and afternoon to night in a day. We noted the diffusion of contamination over the area around Beijing, and found the steady presence of a transport routine of contamination over North-China throughout the year caused by the Coupling Effect mentioned above. This find is important for studying the environment pollution in this area.},

In this study, the effects of building layout patterns and trees arrangement on the outdoor wind environment and thermal comfort at the pedestrian level were investigated by using Simulation Platform for Outdoor Thermal Environment (SPOTE). The conclusions were summarized as follows: 1) it has been found that trees arrangement, buildings layout patterns and their orientations with respect to wind have significant effects on the outdoor wind environment and pedestrian level thermal comfort. The long facades of building, which are parallel to the prevailing wind direction, can accelerate horizontal vortex airflow at the edges and obtain pleasant thermal comfort and wind environment at pedestrian level. 2) Configurations that contain a square central space articulated by buildings and oriented toward the prevailing wind can offer better exposure to air currents as a result of attenuated revised standard effective temperature (SET*). Such configurations are regarded as the optimum building layout patterns and trees arrangement.},

abstract = {A highly developed industry and a large population density have turned the western plain of Taiwan into a mega-suburb with many cities and small towns and countless factories, and roads. As a result, the western plain is experiencing a regional heat-island effect. The MM5 mesoscale model was conducted in order to study and evaluate the impacts of the heat-island effect on regional weather, including thunderstorms, over Taiwan. According to land use data provided by the US Geological Survey (USGS), we assumed three different urban sizes in the simulation study to theoretically evaluate the impact of urbanization on the precipitation. Along with urban size increase in central Taiwan, more pronounced effects of meteorological parameters were shown in the sensitivity experiment with urban cases. For the urban case (case SA, with urban size 15×15 km2), sensible heat flux is nearly 500 W m-2around noon-time. It is about a factor of 3 more than the non-urban case (case CT) over the western plain. The surface air temperature in case SA increased by nearly 3 °C and humidity decreased with nearly 10{\%} more than case CT. Along with the urban size increases in central Taiwan, the effects are the surrounding areas and were more pronounced not only the precipitation over downwind areas. Apparently, the unique and complex topographic features in Taiwan, including the lifting effect of the mountain bordering the western plain, are also play important roles for precipitation formation. Numerical study suggests that the heat-island effect over the western plain could perturb thermal and dynamic processes and hence affect the location of thunderstorms and precipitation over Taiwan's western plain. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Noah land surface model was tested over the city of Athens, Greece, during two selected days. Model results were compared against observations, revealing a satisfactory performance of the modeling system. According to the numerical simulation, the city of Athens exhibits higher air temperatures than its surroundings during the night ({\textgreater}4 °C), whereas the temperature contrast is less evident in early morning and mid-day hours. The minimum and maximum intensity of the canopy-layer heat island were found to occur in early morning and during the night, respectively. The simulations, in agreement with concurrent observations, showed that the intensity of the canopy-layer heat island has a typical diurnal cycle, characterized by high nighttime values, an abrupt decrease following sunrise, and an increase following sunset. The examination of the spatial patterns of the land surface temperature revealed the existence of a surface urban heat sink during the day. In the nighttime, the city surface temperature was found to be higher than its surroundings. Finally, a simple data assimilation algorithm for satellite-retrieved land surface temperature was evaluated. The ingestion of the land surface temperature data into the model resulted to a small reduction in the temperature bias, generally less than 0.2 °C, which was only evident during the first 4-5 h following the assimilation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Monthly mean surface air temperature data from 463 meteorological stations, including those from the 1981-2007 ordinary and national basic reference surface stations in east China and from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis, are used to investigate the effect of rapid urbanization on temperature change. These stations are dynamically classified into six categories, namely, metropolis, large city, medium-sized city, small city, suburban, and rural, using satellite-measured nighttime light imagery and population census data. Both observation minus reanalysis (OMR) and urban minus rural (UMR) methods are utilized to detect surface air temperature change induced by urbanization. With objective and dynamic station classification, the observed and reanalyzed temperature changes over rural areas show good agreement, indicating that the reanalysis can effectively capture regional rural temperature trends. The trends of urban heat island (UHI) effects, determined using OMR and UMR approaches, are generally consistent and indicate that rapid urbanization has a significant influence on surface warming over east China. Overall, UHI effects contribute 24.2{\%} to regional average warming trends. The strongest effect of urbanization on annual mean surface air temperature trends occurs over the metropolis and large city stations, with corresponding contributions of about 44{\%} and 35{\%} to total warming, respectively. The UHI trends are 0.398degC and 0.26degC decade 1. The most substantial UHI effect occurred after the early 2000s, implying a significant effect of rapid urbanization on surface air temperature change during this period.},

abstract = {We examined the horizontal and vertical noctur- nal cooling influence of a small park with irrigated lawn and xeric surfaces (∼3 ha) within a university campus of a hot arid city. Temperature data from 0.01- to 3-m heights observed during a bicycle traverse of the campus were combined with modeled spatial temperature data simulated from a three-dimensional microclimate model (ENVI-met 3.1). A distinct park cool island, with mean observed magnitudes of 0.7–3.6°C, was documented for both traverse and model data with larger cooling intensities measured closer to surface level. Modeled results possessed varying but generally reasonable accuracy in simulating both spatial and temporal temperature data, although some systematic errors exist. A combination of several factors, such as variations in surface thermal properties, urban geometry, building orientation, and soil moisture, was likely responsible for influencing differential urban and non-urban near-surface temperatures. A strong inversion layer up to 1 m over non-urban surfaces was detected, contrasting with near-neutral lapse rates over urban sur- faces. A key factor in the spatial expansion of the park cool island was the advection of cooler park air to adjacent urban surfaces, although this effect was mostly concentrated from 0- to 1-m heights over urban surfaces that were more exposed to the atmosphere.},

The city has been divided in five geographic zones presenting different thermal balances and it is found that the differences between the mean and maximum daily air temperatures, among the five areas, were statistically significant, showing that the five areas of this analysis had definitely different temperature conditions. Higher air temperatures are found in the industrial western part of the city and also the center while the lower values were presented at the northern and the eastern parts. The intensity of the phenomenon is found to be close to 5 C. Statistical methods have been developed and the mean and maximum nocturnal air temperatures as well as the number of hours where air temperature exceeds 30 °C, can be estimated using the corresponding diurnal temperature values. The overall analysis is important to identify energy and comfort problems in the city and plan in a sustainable way the rehabilitation of the zones presenting important thermal problems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper reports the measured solar spectral properties and the thermal performance of 10 prototype cool colored coatings, developed at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, using near-infrared reflective color pigments in comparison to color-matched, conventionally pigmented coatings. These coatings are developed to be used in the urban environment to fight the heat island effect. The spectral reflectance and the infrared emittance were measured and the solar reflectance of the samples was calculated. The surface temperature of the coatings when applied to concrete tiles was monitored, using surface temperature sensors and a data logging system, on 24 h basis from August to December 2005 in an effort to investigate the ability of the cool colored coatings to maintain lower surface temperatures than conventionally pigmented color-matched coatings. The data obtained has been extensively analysed and indicate significant success in the development of these cool colored coatings. It was found that all the coatings containing infrared reflective pigments have solar reflectance values higher than those of standard coatings. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that cool colored coatings maintain lower surface temperatures than color-matched conventionally pigmented coatings. This temperature difference is mainly due to differences in solar reflectance. These cool colored coatings can be used on buildings (roofs and walls) and other surfaces in the urban environment. Thus, at building scale, the use of cool colored coatings with increased solar reflectance can improve building comfort and reduce cooling energy use, and at city city-scale it can contribute to the reduction of the air temperature due to the heat-transfer phenomena and therefore improve outdoor thermal comfort and reduce the heat-island effect. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The linear correlation between ozone concentration and air temperature values as well as the temporal variation of temperature and ozone concentration, for the above-mentioned experimental stations, were calculated and analysed. Moreover, a neural network approach was used for investigating the impact of temperature on the ozone concentration values over the greater Athens area.

abstract = {Measurements have been performed during summer in and around a medium size urban park located in the western part of Athens, Greece. Additional temperature data from 15 urban and suburban stations are used to perform comparative analysis at the city level. The park presents an important temperature inhomogeneity during both day and night. Average nocturnal cool island intensities against the reference urban stations varied between -0.7. K and -2.8. K, while during the daytime the average maximum cool island intensity (CII) was between -0.2. K and -2.6. K. A statistical significant correlation between the CII and the population density is found for both day and night. The park was warmer than the urban stations for ambient temperatures lower than 34. °C, while for higher urban temperatures the park was cooler and the absolute CII increased as a function of the ambient temperature. An important correlation with the wind speed is observed for wind speeds higher than 6. m/s. The mitigation potential of the park was assessed by performing three types of traverses around the park. The park cooling intensity was varying between 3.3 and 3.8. K, while the temperature gradient along the traverses changes as a function of the thermal properties of the urban areas and was between 0.2 and 1.4. K/100. m. The park cooling intensity presents a strong correlation with the wind speed for values higher than 5. m/s. The climatic influence of the park was extended up to 300. m from the borders of the park. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Camilloni1997,
abstract = {For U.S., Argentine and Australian cities, yearly mean urban to rural temperature differ-ences (Tu,r) and rural temperatures (Tr) are negatively correlated in almost every case, suggesting that urban heat island intensity depends, among other parameters on the temperature itself. This negative correlation is related to the fact that interannual variability of temperature is generally lower in urban environments than in rural areas. This seems to hold true at low frequencies leading to opposite trends in the two variables. Hence, urban stations are prone to have lower trends in absolute value than rural ones. Therefore, regional data sets including records from urban locations, in addition to urban growth bias may have a second type of urban bias associated with temperature trends. A bulk estimate of this second urban bias trend for the contiguous United States during 1901–1984 indicates that it could be of the same order as the urban growth bias and of opposite sign. If these results could be extended to global data, it could be expected that the spurious influence of urban growth on global temperature trends during warming periods will be offset by the diminishing of the urban heat island intensity.},

Several types of cool materials have been tested and their optical and thermal properties reveal that these materials can be classified as “cool” with the ability to maintain lower surface temperatures. Cool materials can be used on buildings and other surfaces of the urban environment. Based on these results, a modeling study was undertaken to assess the urban heat island effect over Athens, Greece, a densely populated city, by trying to analyze the impacts of large-scale increases in surface albedo on ambient temperature. Numerical simulations were performed by the “urbanized” version of the nonhydrostatic fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5, version 3-6-1). Two scenarios of modified albedo were studied: a moderate and an extreme increase in albedo scenario. It was found that large-scale increases in albedo could lower ambient air temperatures by 2°C. Furthermore, the impact of high albedo measures on heat island magnitude was estimated by creating a spatial representation of the urban heat island effect over the modeled area. The results of this study can help to promote the adoption of high albedo measures in building energy codes and urban planning regulations.},

The phenomenon is experienced at all latitudes and, combined with the global warming, has a severe impact at environment, energy and health level. The increasing of solar reflectance of urban materials is a strategy aimed at reducing surface and air temperatures and at mitigating the UHI. Cool materials applied to conventional asphalts are a viable technology for such purposes. The optical and thermal characterisation was carried out in laboratory and outdoor, and showed the enhanced properties and performances of several cool asphalt samples compared to conventional materials. The experimental data were used as input to simulate the thermal environment of a densely populated neighbourhood in Rome, estimating the effect of the roads albedo on the temperature air profile. Simulations performed with the software ENVI-met showed a significant reduction of air temperature closely correlated with the road solar reflectance. The air temperature profiles were used as input to calculate the impact of the albedo change at the building level. Simulations on the peak cooling demand of typical Italian dwellings were carried out by means of the TRNSYS dynamic simulation tool. Peak reductions of almost 19{\%} were calculated for the highest solar reflectance configuration. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Outdoor thermal comfort in urban spaces is known as an important contributor to pedestrians' health. The urban microclimate is also important more generally through its influence on urban air quality and the energy use of buildings. These issues are likely to become more acute as increased urbanisation and climate change exacerbate the urban heat island effect. Careful urban planning, however, may be able to provide for cooler urban environments. Different urban forms provide different microclimates with different comfort situations for pedestrians. In this paper, singular East-West and North-South, linear East-West and North-South, and a courtyard form were analysed for the hottest day so far in the temperate climate of the Netherlands (19th June 2000 with the maximum 33°C air temperature). ENVI-met was used for simulating outdoor air temperature, mean radiant temperature, wind speed and relative humidity whereas RayMan was used for converting these data into Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET). The models with different compactness provided different thermal environments. The results demonstrate that duration of direct sun and mean radiant temperature, which are influenced by urban form, play the most important role in thermal comfort. This paper also shows that the courtyard provides the most comfortable microclimate in the Netherlands in June compared to the other studied urban forms. The results are validated through a field measurement and calibration.},

abstract = {Green roofs have multiple environmental benefits and are widely used around the world. In keeping with this mainstream movement, the use of green roofs has been increasing in Taiwan in recent years. This paper reviews policies promoting green roof development in Taiwan, and compares the environmental and economic performance of green roofs in Taiwan to those in East Asian countries and worldwide. National and regional government policies have stimulated the development of green roofs by establishing goals for reducing carbon emissions of cities, promoting green construction, mitigating heat island effects, and increasing urban flood control. Local studies of green roof performance are few, other than thermal investigations. These studies have shown that green roofs significantly contribute to thermal reduction and moderate temperature variations around buildings. One study sampled stormwater runoff from green roof sites and found that sediment and nutrient concentration on these roofs are up to ten times higher than on conventional bare roofs; however, acid rain can be neutralized by green roofs. Hydrographs have shown that reductions in runoff from green roofs are not as great as expected because retention and detention are affected by high rainfall intensity, which is the typical precipitation pattern in Taiwanese cities. Without additional maintenance, green roofs can contribute to nonpoint source pollution in urban cities in wet and hot weather zones, because of high runoff and associated mass loading. Moreover, the environmental benefits of green roofs in Taiwan may not be as significant as those in other countries in which utility costs are higher, where decreasing energy consumption and CO2emissions would be of greater benefit. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this study, the performances of two widely-used models in air quality community, The Air Pollution Model (TAPM) and the PSU/NCAR fifth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM5), were evaluated and compared at an urban scale (a few kilometres) in the greater Gothenburg (Sweden) using the GOTE2001 campaign data. Evaluation focused on simulated meteorological variables important to air quality applications: the near-surface air temperature and wind, vertical temperature gradient, low wind speed situation, diurnal cycle and diurnal heating. The results showed that (1) TAPM performs better than MM5 in simulating near-surface air temperature and wind in urban area, (2) both models are able to reproduce nighttime vertical temperature gradient reasonably well, but underestimate daytime temperature gradient, and (3) the two models significantly underestimate the occurrences of low wind speed situation at night. These results indicate that the performance of TAPM in simulating meteorological features over the urban area is generally comparable to that of MM5. TAPM can be used with some confidence to describe the local-scale meteorology needed for air quality applications},

abstract = {Global climate change is likely to alter the phenological patterns of plants due to the controlling effects of climate on plant ontogeny, especially in an urbanized environment. We studied relationships between various phenophases (i.e., seasonal biological events) and interannual variations of air temperature in three woody plant species (Prunus davidiana, Hibiscus syriacus, and Cercis chinensis) in the Beijing Metropolis, China, based on phenological data for the period 1962-2004 and meteorological data for the period 1951-2004. Analysis of phenology and climate data indicated significant changes in spring and autumn phenophases and temperatures. Changes in phenophases were observed for all the three species, consistent with patterns of rising air temperatures in the Beijing Metropolis. The changing phenology in the three plant species was reflected mainly as advances of the spring phenophases and delays in the autumn phenophases, but with strong variations among species and phenophases in response to different temperature indices. Most phenophases (both spring and autumn phenophases) had significant relationships with temperatures of the preceding months. There existed large inter- and intra-specific variations, however, in the responses of phenology to climate change. It is clear that the urban heat island effect from 1978 onwards is a dominant cause of the observed phenological changes. Differences in phenological responses to climate change may cause uncertain ecological consequences, with implications for ecosystem stability and function in urban environments.},

abstract = {A pedestrian-centered conceptual model is used for the computation of energy exchange in the urban environment, based on data measured within a physical model and taking into account the effects of dimensional scaling. The physical open-air scale model, used for evaluating the influence of street canyon geometry on microclimatic conditions and pedestrian energy exchange within the urban canopy, enables measurement of climatic parameters with natural radiation and turbulence effects-potentially overcoming some of the limitations common to more conventional research techniques. The modeling technique is applied under typical hot-arid summer conditions in a desert region, and patterns of pedestrian energy exchange are compared with previous findings from full-scale measurements in a climatically similar actual urban setting. Results clearly indicate that a compact street canyon geometry may reduce pedestrian heat gain during most summer hours, but that the reduction is contingent on design aspects such as street axis orientation. Comparison of model results with full-scale measurements shows the ability of the scale model to reproduce patterns observed in full scale, and to reveal distinctions that are impractical to quantify using field studies alone. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Increased nighttime temperatures caused by retained heat in urban areas is a phenomenon known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Urbanization requires an increase in pavement surface area, which contributes to UHI as a result of unfavorable heat retention properties. In recent years, alternative pavement designs have become more common in an attempt to mitigate the environmental impacts of urbanization. Specifically, porous pavements are gaining popularity in the paving industry because of their attractive storm water mitigation and friction properties. However, little information regarding the thermal behavior of these materials is available. This paper explores the extent to which porous asphalt pavement influences pavement temperatures and investigates the impact on UHI by considering the diurnal temperature cycle. A one-dimensional pavement temperature model developed at Arizona State University was used to model surface temperatures of porous asphalt, traditional dense-graded asphalt, and portland cement concrete pavements. Scenarios included variations in pavement thickness, structure, and albedo. Thermal conductivity testing was performed on porous asphalt mixtures to obtain values for current and future analysis. In general, porous asphalt exhibited higher daytime surface temperatures than the other pavements because of the reduced thermal energy transfer from the surface to subsurface layers. However, porous asphalt showed the lowest nighttime temperatures compared with other materials with a similar or higher albedo. This trend can be attributed to the unique insulating properties of this material, which result from a high air void content. As anticipated, the outcome of this study indicated that pavement impact on UHI is a complex problem and that important interactions between influencing factors such as pavement thickness, structure, material type, and albedo must be considered.},

Monitoring the urban heat island in four areas of New York City, we have found an average of 2°C difference of temperatures between the most and the least vegetated areas, ascribable to the substitution of vegetation with man-made building materials. At micro-scale, we have assessed the effect of surface albedo on climate through the use of a climatological model. Then, using the CO2equivalents as indicators of the impact on climate, we have compared the surface albedo, and the construction, replacement and use phase of a black, a white and a green roof. By our analyses, we found that both the white and the green roofs are less impactive than the black one; with the thermal resistance, the biological activity of plants and the surface albedo playing a crucial role. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Quantitative information about outdoor thermal comfort, on various temporal and spatial scales, is required to design better cities and mitigate heat problems not only in warm but also in temperate climates. The overall objective of this study is to explore the augmentation of global/regional climate changes by urban features such as geometry in a compact mid-rise high-latitude city (Gothenburg). The magnitude of spatial and temporal variations of intra-urban mean radiant temperatures (Tmrt) is quantified using the SOLWEIG (SOlar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry) model. Hourly time resolution, statistically downscaled meteorological data, based on the ECHAM5-GCM under the A1B emission scenario is used to simulate changes in Tmrt and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) at the 20802099 time horizon. Results show that urban geometry causes large intra-urban differences in Tmrt, on hourly, daytime and yearly time scales. In general, open areas are warmer than adjacent narrow street canyons in summer, but cooler in winter. According to the ECHAM5-based scenario, the daytime Tmrt will increase by 3.2 C by the end of this century. This is 0.4 more than simulated increase in air temperature (2.8 C) and is mainly a result of decreases in summer cloudiness. Occasions of strong/extreme heat stress are expected to triple. This equates to 20100 h a year, depending on geometry. Conversely, the number of hours with strong/extreme cold stress decreases by 400450 h. Furthermore, the number of hours with no thermal stress increases by 40200 h a year. The study confirms the potential for using geometry to mitigate daytime thermal stress. A densely built structure mitigates extreme swings in Tmrt and PET, improving outdoor comfort conditions both in summer and in winter. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of including information on either Tmrt or thermal comfort in climate scenarios to describe the combined effects of changes in multiple climate variables and to more realistically measure the impact on humans.

This numerical experiment indicated that complex non-linear land-atmosphere interactions, involving mesoscale and turbulent (microscale) processes, are generated when patches of vegetation are grown (or cut) in urban areas. Various simulations, supported by observational evidences collected during METROMEX, demonstrated that vegetation can substantially affect the wind, temperature, moisture, and precipitation regime of urban areas. Thus, vegetation is believed to have very important practical applications in urban planning, e.g. heating and cooling requirements of buildings, dispersion and concentration of pollutants, and urban weather. If planned carefully, vegetation could be used to mitigate some of the anthropogenic effects generated by the development of urban areas.},

Knowledge about the implications of heat exposure to human health is growing, with excess mortality and illness occurring during hot weather in diverse regions. Certain groups, including the elderly, the urban poor, and those with chronic health conditions, are at higher risk. Preventive actions include: establishing heat wave warning systems; making cool environments available (through air conditioning or other means); public education; planting trees and other vegetation; and modifying the built environment to provide proper ventilation and use materials and colors that reduce heat build-up and optimize thermal comfort. However, to inspire local prevention activities, easily understood information about the strategies' benefits needs to be incorporated into decision tools. Integrating heat health information into a comprehensive adaptation planning process can alert local decision-makers to extreme heat risks and provide information necessary to choose strategies that yield the largest health improvements and cost savings. Tools to enable this include web-based programs that illustrate effective methods for including heat health in comprehensive local-level adaptation planning; calculate costs and benefits of several activities; maps showing zones of high potential heat exposure and vulnerable populations in a local area; and public awareness materials and training for implementing preventive activities. A new computer-based decision tool will enable local estimates of heat-related health effects and potential savings from implementing a range of prevention strategies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {High-resolution numerical simulations of the urban heat island (UHI) effect with the widely-used Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are assessed. Both the sensitivity of the results to the simulation setup, and the quality of the simulated fields as representations of the real world, are investigated. Results indicate that the WRF-simulated surface temperatures are more sensitive to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme choice during nighttime, and more sensitive to the surface thermal roughness length parameterization during daytime. The urban surface temperatures simulated by WRF are also highly sensitive to the urban canopy model (UCM) used. The implementation in this study of an improved UCM (the Princeton UCM or PUCM) that allows the simulation of heterogeneous urban facets and of key hydrological processes, together with the so-called CZ09 parameterization for the thermal roughness length, significantly reduce the bias ({\textless}1.5 °C) in the surface temperature fields as compared to satellite observations during daytime. The boundary layer potential temperature profiles are captured by WRF reasonable well at both urban and rural sites; the biases in these profiles relative to aircraft-mounted senor measurements are on the order of 1.5 °C. Changing UCMs and PBL schemes does not alter the performance of WRF in reproducing bulk boundary layer temperature profiles significantly. The results illustrate the wide range of urban environmental conditions that various configurations of WRF can produce, and the significant biases that should be assessed before inferences are made based on WRF outputs. The optimal set-up of WRF-PUCM developed in this paper also paves the way for a confident exploration of the city-scale impacts of UHI mitigation strategies in the companion paper (Li et al 2014).},

abstract = {Outdoor shading affects the thermal environment and human thermal comfort, thereby influencing the usage of space. The objective of this study is to establish a relationship between the thermal environment and number of people visiting an outdoor space, and to explore the utilization of outdoor space during different seasons with various shading levels. This study includes onsite investigations of the microclimate parameters of the thermal environment and attendance at a park in central Taiwan. The results in cool seasons showed a positive correlation among the air temperature, mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) of shaded areas and the number of visitors. In hot seasons, the Tmrt and PET, which also reflect solar radiation conditions, are negatively correlated with the number of visitors. In other words, the higher Tmrt/PET values indicate that fewer people visit the park during the summer. Meanwhile, a significant correlation exists between park utilization and solar radiation conditions. This study proposes the use of area-averaged sky view factor (SVFa), instead of the traditional single-point sky view factor from fisheye photographs (SVFsp), as the indicator for measuring the shading level at various areas in parks. Analytical results indicate that the lower the SVFa, the higher the park utilization. This study highlights the importance of shade design in parks located in tropical or subtropical climates. The results can serve as a reference for park design in the future. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Analyses taken over all observed weather conditions of daily 0600 EST climate data from a network of monitoring stations in and around the large city of Melbourne, Australia, revealed a 20-yr mean urban heat island (UHI) value of 1.13?C. The UHI varied seasonally between summer (1.29?C), spring (1.25?C), autumn (1.02?C), and winter (0.98?C). Investigations undertaken with daily wind speed and cloud amount data enabled a detailed investigation of the relative importance of factors such as the turbulent and radiative exchanges on Melbourne's UHI. Analysis of variance and regression techniques were used to explore these processes and to predict the behavior of the UHI in numerical terms for mean seasonal and annual periods between 1972 and 1991. Over the 20-yr period, analyses of the association among Melbourne's UHI, wind, and cloud revealed that the UHI was inversely proportional to approximately the fourth root of both the wind speed and the cloud amount. This relationship explained more of the UHI variance during summer and the least variance during winter. Increases in the amount of cloud cover and in the frequency of wind speeds in excess of 2.0 m s?1 resulted in a statistically significant (95{\%} confidence level) reduction in UHI magnitude. The influence of wind in limiting Melbourne's UHI magnitude was greatest during clear to near-clear sky conditions. Similarly increases in cloud were most restrictive to UHI development during calm to low wind speeds. Unlike most previous studies, the linear regression analysis presented here revealed that cloud was more limiting than the wind speed to UHI development for all seasons except summer. Contour plots of the UHI are presented for the various associations between each category of cloud and wind. These plots enable a clear visual presentation of the most to least favorable conditions for UHI intensity and development. The analyses indicate that low wind speeds and little or no cloud were typically associated with the largest UHI development. Eight octas of cloud and wind speeds in excess of 5.0 m s?1 were usually associated with modest (but still apparent) UHI development},

abstract = {Facade greening is expected to mitigate urban heat stress through shading, transpiration cooling and thermal insulation. This study quantifies cooling effects of facade greenings for the building and the street canyon and distinguishes between transpiration and shading effects. Additionally it discusses insulation effects. Outdoor experiments were conducted during hot summer periods on three building facades in Berlin, Germany. We determined transpiration rates (sap flow) and surface temperatures of greened and bare walls as well as of plant leaves (temperature probes) of three climbing plants: Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Hedera helix and Fallopia baldschuanica. Furthermore, air temperature, relative humidity and incoming short-wave radiation were measured. No cooling effect was detectable for the street canyon. Surface temperatures of the greened exterior walls were up to 15.5 °C lower than those of the bare walls, while it was up to 1.7 °C for the interior wall (measured during night-time). The cooling effects mainly depended on shading, whereas a lower proportion was due to transpiration. Insulation of the direct greenings reduced radiation during night-time. We conclude that greening can be an effective strategy to mitigate indoor heat stress as long as the plants are sufficiently irrigated with up to 2.5 L m-2d-1per wall area.},

abstract = {The Urban Heat Island (UHI) is one of the most well documented phenomena in urban climatology. Although a range of measurements and modelling techniques can be used to assess the UHI, the paucity of traditional meteorological observations in urban areas has been an ongoing limitation for studies. The availability of remote sensing data has therefore helped fill a scientific need by providing high resolution temperature data of our cities. However, satellite-mounted sensors measure land surface temperatures (LST) and not canopy air temperatures with the latter being the key parameter in UHI investigations. Fortunately, such data is becoming increasingly available via urban meteorological networks, which now provide an opportunity to quantify and compare surface and canopy UHI on an unprecedented scale. For the first time, this study uses high resolution air temperature data from the Birmingham Urban Climate Laboratory urban meteorological network and MODIS LST to quantify and identify the spatial pattern of the daytime and night-time UHI in Birmingham, UK (a city with an approximate population of 1 million). This analysis is performed under a range of atmospheric stability classes and investigates the relationship between surface and canopy UHI in the city. A significant finding of this work is that it demonstrates, using observations, that the distribution of the surface UHI appears to be clearly linked to landuse, whereas for canopy UHI, advective processes appear to play an increasingly important role. Strong relationships were found between air temperatures and LST during both the day and night at a neighbourhood scale, but even with the use of higher resolution urban meteorological datasets, relationships at the city scale are still limited.},

abstract = {The urban thermal environment varies not only from its rural surroundings but also within the urban area due to intra-urban differences in land-use and surface characteristics. Understanding the causes of this intra-urban variability is a first step in improving urban planning and development. Toward this end, a method for quantifying causes of spatial variability in the urban heat island has been developed. This paper presents the method as applied to a specific test case of Portland, Oregon. Vehicle temperature traverses were used to determine spatial differences in summertime {\~{}}2 m air temperature across the metropolitan area in the afternoon. A tree-structured regression model was used to quantify the land-use and surface characteristics that have the greatest influence on daytime UHI intensity. The most important urban characteristic separating warmer from cooler regions of the Portland metropolitan area was canopy cover. Roadway area density was also an important determinant of local UHI magnitudes. Specifically, the air above major arterial roads was found to be warmer on weekdays than weekends, possibly due to increased anthropogenic activity from the vehicle sector on weekdays. In general, warmer regions of the city were associated with industrial and commercial land-use. The downtown core, whilst warmer than the rural surroundings, was not the warmest part of the Portland metropolitan area. This is thought to be due in large part to local shading effects in the urban canyons.},

abstract = {The two main forcings that can counteract to some extent the positive forcings from greenhouse gases from pre-industrial times to present day are the aerosol and related aerosol-cloud forcings, and the radiative response to changes in surface albedo. Here, we quantify the change in radiative forcing and land surface temperature that may be obtained by increasing the albedos of roofs and pavements in urban areas in temperate and tropical regions of the globe by 0.1. Using the catchment land surface model (the land model coupled to the GEOS-5 Atmospheric General Circulation Model), we quantify the change in the total outgoing (outgoing shortwave+longwave) radiation and land surface temperature to a 0.1 increase in urban albedos for all global land areas. The global average increase in the total outgoing radiation was 0.5 W m −2 , and temperature decreased by {\~{}}0.008 K for an average 0.003 increase in surface albedo. These averages represent all global land areas where data were available from the land surface model used and are for the boreal summer (June–July–August). For the continental US the total outgoing radiation increased by 2.3 W m −2 , and land surface temperature decreased by {\~{}}0.03 K for an average 0.01 increase in surface albedo. Based on these forcings, the expected emitted CO 2 offset for a plausible 0.25 and 0.15 increase in albedos of roofs and pavements, respectively, for all global urban areas, was found to be {\~{}}57 Gt CO 2 . A more meaningful evaluation of the impacts of urban albedo increases on global climate and the expected CO 2 offsets would require simulations which better characterize urban surfaces and represent the full annual cycle.},

abstract = {Mean, maximum and minimum surface air temperatures recorded at 70 climatological stations in Turkey during the period from 1929 to 1999 were analysed to reveal spatial and temporal patterns of long-term trends, change points, significant warming (cooling) periods and linear trend rates per decade. Annual, winter and spring mean temperatures have tended to increase, particularly over the southern regions of Turkey, whereas summer and particularly autumn mean temperatures have decreased over the northern and continental inner regions. Annual, winter, spring and summer maximum temperatures have indicated a positive trend at many stations, except those in the Central Anatolia and Black Sea regions and partly in the Eastern Anatolia region. Autumn maximum temperatures, however, have decreased slightly over much of Turkey, except for the Aegean region. The majority of the urbanized and rapidly urbanizing stations in Turkey have been experiencing an apparent night-time warming, especially during the warm and dry period of the year. Minimum temperatures have shown a statistically significant positive trend at 31 stations annually, 30 stations in spring and 33 stations in summer; most are significant at the 0.01 level. Winter and autumn minimum temperatures have indicated a general negative trend in some portions of the Marmara, Black Sea and Eastern Anatolia regions, whereas a general positive trend has been seen over much of Turkey along with the significant trends in the Mediterranean region of the country. Summer night-time warming rates are generally larger than in spring and autumn night-time temperatures. On the other hand, the night-time warming rates of spring and summer are generally stronger than those in spring and summer daytime temperatures. By considering the marked increasing trends in spring, summer and annual minimum temperatures of urban stations, we have recognized that this is a clear and significant indication for the existence of a strong night-time urban warming in Turkey},

The possibilities of reduction in air conditioning energy were investigated. Air temperature, relative humidity and other meteorological factors were measured at many locations inside a park and in the surrounding areas in the Tama New Town, a city in the west of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, Japan. The observations indicated that vegetation could significantly alter the climate in the town. At noon, the highest temperature of the ground surface of the grass field in the park was 40.3 °C, which was 19 °C lower than that of the asphalt surface or 15 °C lower than that of the concrete surface in the parking or commercial areas. At the same time, air temperature measured at 1.2 m above the ground at the grass field inside the park was more than 2 °C lower than that measured at the same height in the surrounding commercial and parking areas. Soon after sunset, the temperature of the ground surface at the grass field in the park became lower than that of the air, and the park became a cool island whereas paved asphalt or concrete surfaces in the town remained hotter than the overlying air even late at night. With a size of about 0.6 km2, at noon, the park can reduce by up to 1.5 °C the air temperature in a busy commercial area 1 km downwind. This can lead to a significant decrease of in air conditioning energy in the commercial area.},

abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) is a worldwide phenomenon, which causes many ecological and social consequences. Urban greenspace can decrease environmental temperature and thus alleviate UHI effects. Spatial pattern of greenspace, both composition and configuration, significantly affects land surface temperature (LST). Results from previous studies, however, showed inconsistent, or even contradictory relationships between LST and spatial pattern of greenspace, suggesting these relationships may be scale dependent (sensitive to spatial resolution). But few studies have explicitly addressed this issue. This paper examines whether the spatial resolution of the imagery used to map urban greenspace affect the relationship between LST and spatial pattern of greenspace, using Beijing, China as a case study. Spatial pattern of greenspace was measured with seven landscape metrics at three spatial resolutions (2.44. m, 10. m, and 30. m) based on QuickBird, SPOT, and TM imagery. LST was derived from thermal band of Landsat TM imagery. The relationship between LST and spatial pattern of greenspace was examined by Pearson correlation and partial Pearson correlation analysis using census tract as analytical unit. Results showed that landscape metrics of greenspace varied by spatial resolution. Imagery with higher spatial resolution could more accurately quantify the spatial pattern of greenspace. The relationship between LST and abundance of greenspace was consistently negative, but the relationship between LST and spatial configuration of greenspace varied by spatial resolution. This study extended our scientific understanding of the effects of spatial pattern, especial spatial configuration of greenspace on LST. In addition, it can provide insights for urban greenspace planning and management. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

UHIs influence human well-being, human health and the city as an ecological niche. UHIs can be quantified with meteorological ground measurements of air temperatures or with remotely sensed land surface temperatures (surface urban heat island). Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages and are rarely combined. Further, within these approaches, different indicators for quantifying the UHIs are used. In this methodological study, we (1) combined data on land surface and air temperatures, (2) enriched the debate by suggesting the application of indicators for the two distinct data sets and (3) systematically quantified indicators of all approaches for the city of Leipzig, Germany. A relationship between the land surface and air temperatures was established. However, the results for the single indicators showed that the absolute values of the detected UHI in Leipzig depend on the selected indicator and the data set used. The main conclusion for future studies on UHIs is to use several UHI indicators in parallel to acknowledge the uncertainty of measuring the UHI using a single indicator and either ground measurements or remote sensing. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A night-time thermal image from the ASTER satellite sensor, of the western New territories of Hong Kong is compared with a daytime Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) thermal image obtained nineteen days earlier. Densely built high rise areas which appear cool on daytime images are conversely, relatively warm on nighttime images, though the temperature differences are not well developed at night. Lower temperature gradients between different land cover types observed on the night time image result in meso-scale, rather than micro-scale climatic patterns being dominant, suggestive of processes operating in the Urban Boundary Layer (UBL), as opposed to the Urban Canopy Layer (UCL) which is dominant in the daytime. Thus, at night, proximity to extensive cool surfaces such as forested mountain slopes appears to be influential in maintaining cooler building temperatures. The relevance of satellite-derived surface temperatures for studies of urban microclimate is supported by field data of surface and air temperatures collected in the study area. Comparison of the ASTER Kinetic Temperature standard product with a thermal image processed using locally derived emissivity and atmospheric data indicated higher accuracy for the latter. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},

abstract = {A new parametrization for the surface energy balance of urban areas is presented. It is shown that this new method can represent some of the important urban phenomena, such as an urban heat island and the occurrence of a near-neutral nocturnal boundary layer with associated positive turbulent heat fluxes, unlike the traditional method for representing urban areas within operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The basis of the new parametrization is simple and can be applied easily within an operational NWP model. Also, it has no additional computational expense compared to the traditional scheme and is hence applicable for operational forecasting requirements. The results show that the errors for London within the Met Office operational mesoscale model have been significantly reduced since the new scheme was introduced. The bias and root-mean-square (rms) errors have been approximately halved, with the rms error now similar to the model as a whole. The results also show that a seasonal cycle still exists in the model errors, but it is suggested that this may be caused by anthropogenic heat sources that are neglected in the urban scheme.},

abstract = {The number of hot days is increasing in many parts of the world because of the heat island phenomenon and global climate change. High air temperature greatly affects human thermal comfort and public health, particularly in urban areas. Therefore, the challenging task of, urban designers and urban planners in accommodating the increasing population is to make cities with the least level of vulnerability to future climate change. Interest in transferring urban climatic knowledge into urban planning practices, and developing mitigation strategies to adapt to climate change, has been increased in recent years. The use of vegetation and appropriate urban geometry are shown very promising in mitigating the adverse effects of heat island and providing a better pedestrian thermal comfort. This article reviews studies on pedestrian level urban greening and geometry in improving thermal comfort in cities. Such strategies can be applied at the preliminary stages of urban planning and thus directly affect the microclimate. The analyzed data include simulation and field measurement studies. The discussion of this research clearly reflects how urban design guidelines can be applied to enhance outdoor thermal comfort and minimize the heat island effect. This study is helpful in controlling the consequences of city design from the early design stage.},

abstract = {Exposures to dangerously high temperatures are a public health threat expected to increase with global climate change. Heat waves exacerbate the risks associated with heat exposure, and urban residents are particularly vulnerable to threats of heat waves due to the urban heat island effect. To understand how heat waves are changing over time, we examine changes in four heat wave characteristics from 1961 to 2010, frequency, duration, intensity, and timing, in 50 large US cities. Our purpose in measuring these trends is to assess the extent to which urban populations are increasingly exposed to heat-related health hazards resulting from changing trends in extreme heat. We find each of these heat wave characteristics to be rising significantly when measured over a five-decade period, with the annual number of heat waves increasing by 0.6 heat waves per decade for the average US city. Additionally, on average, we find the length of heat waves to be increasing by a fifth of a day, the intensity to be increasing 0.1 °C above local thresholds, and the length of the heat wave season (time between first and last heat wave) to be increasing by 6 days per decade. The regions most at risk due to increasing heat wave trends must plan appropriately to manage this growing threat by enhancing emergency preparedness plans and minimizing the urban heat island effect.},

abstract = {This study explores the role of global and local warming on indoor thermal environments of representative buildings in two warm climate cities in the U.S. (Chicago IL, and Houston TX). It uses downscaled climate change scenarios to drive whole-building model simulations of representative apartment buildings. Simulations were conducted under (a) current conditions; (b) conditions that include a global warming effect; and (c) conditions that include global warming with concurrent intensification of the urban heat island. Building thermal conditions are assessed for typical operating conditions, for conditions associated with failure of cooling equipment, and for complete power loss during a heat wave. Simulations show that warming by itself may have minimal effects on indoor thermal comfort in summer. For example, in Houston the Predicted Percent Dissatisfied (PPD) comfort metric was approximately 5-6{\%} for current and future climate scenarios under normal operating conditions. Under conditions of AC failure, however, this increased to 61.9{\%} for the current climate and 71.4{\%} for the 2050 climate. In the case of Chicago PPD was between 6.2{\%} and 7.9{\%} for all climate scenarios when equipment operated normally. Under conditions of equipment failure, however, PPD increased to 34.1{\%} for the current climate and 39.2{\%} for the 2050 climate. In simulations for both cities, a complete power failure resulted in peak temperatures that were approximately 2°C cooler than the case of AC failure only. This is due to reduction in internal gains during a power blackout. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) effects can strengthen heat waves and air pollution episodes. In this study, the dampening impact of urban trees on the UHI during an extreme heat wave in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, metropolitan area is examined by incorporating trees, soil, and grass into the coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model and an urban canopy model (WRF-UCM). By parameterizing the effects of these natural surfaces alongside roadways and buildings, the modified WRF-UCM is used to in- vestigate how urban trees, soil, and grass dampen the UHI. The modified model was run with 50{\%} tree cover over urban roads and a 10{\%} decrease in the width of urban streets to make space for soil and grass alongside the roads and buildings. Results show that, averaged over all urban areas, the added vegetation decreases surface air temperature in urban street canyons by 4.1 K and road-surface and building-wall temperatures by 15.4 and 8.9 K, respectively, as a result of tree shading and evapotranspiration. These temperature changes propagate downwind and alter the temperature gradient associated with the Chesapeake Bay breeze and, therefore, alter the strength of the bay breeze. The impact of building height on theUHI shows that decreasing commercial building heights by 8 m and residential building heights by 2.5 m results in up to 0.4-K higher daytime surface and near-surface air temperatures because of less building shading and up to 1.2-K lower nighttime temperatures because of less longwave radiative trapping in urban street canyons.},

The relationships between surface- and satellite-derived variables were developed during 1989–91 and tested on data acquired during 1992–93. The urban–rural differences in air temperature were linearly related to urban–rural differences in the NDVI and Tsfc . A statistically significant but relatively small (less than 40{\%}) amount of the variation in these urban–rural differences in air temperature [the urban heat island (UHI) bias] was associated with variation in the urban–rural differences in NDVI and Tsfc . A comparison of the satellite-based estimates of the UHI bias with population-based estimates of the UHI bias indicated similar levels of error. The use of satellite-derived data may contribute to a globally consistent method for analysis of the urban heat island bias. 1.},

Accurately assessing the urban system by comparing it with the nearby rural regions helps to identify the impacts of urbanization. This work uses the recent satellite observed aerosol, skin temperature, land cover, albedo, cloud fraction and water vapor measurements to reveal how the city of Shanghai, one of the biggest, dense urban areas in East Asia, affects land surface and atmosphere conditions. In addition, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ground observations from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) is also used to reveal diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations of the heavy aerosol load over Shanghai region. Furthermore, Shanghai reduces surface albedo, total column water vapor, cloud fraction and increases land skin temperature than rural region. These observations prove that Shanghai significantly modifies local and regional land surface physical properties as well as physical processes, which lead to the urban heat island effect (UHI).},

This local circulation is difficult to observe with a simple observational deployment, and the 3D numerical simulations needed to model it are very demanding in computer time. A theoretical approach scaling the daytime urban heat island and urban-breeze characteristics has been developed and provides a simple set of equations that depend on measurable parameters. Three-dimensional high-resolution numerical simulations, performed with the Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale (Meso-NH) atmospheric model, were used to generate a set of urban-breeze circulations forced by an idealized urban environment. The pertinent forcing parameters chosen were the size of the city, the height of the thermal inversion topping the mixed turbulent air layer, and the difference (urban – rural) of surface heat flux.

abstract = {Scale modelling is used to determine the relative contribution of heat transfer processes to the nocturnal cooling of urban parks and the characteristic temporal and spatial variation of surface temperature. Validation is achieved using a hardware model-to-numerical model-to-field observation chain of comparisons. For the calm case, modelling shows that urban-park differences of sky view factor and thermal admittance are the relevant properties governing the park cool island (PCI) effect. Reduction in sky view factor by buildings and trees decreases the drain of longwave radiation from the surface to the sky. Thus park areas near the perimeter where there may be a line of buildings or trees, or even sites within a park containing tree clumps or individual trees, generally cool less than open areas. The edge effect applies within distances of about 2.2 to 3.5 times the height of the border obstruction, i.e., to have any part of the park cooling at the maximum rate a square park must be at least twice these dimensions in width. Although the central areas of parks larger than this will experience greater cooling they will accumulate a larger volume of cold air that may make it possible for them to initiate a thermal circulation and extend the influence of the park into the surrounding city. Given real world values of sky view factor and thermal admittance it seems likely that radiation and conduction play almost equal roles in nocturnal PCI development. Evaporation is not a significant cooling mechanism in the nocturnal calm case but by day it is probably critical in establishing a PCI by sunset. It is likely that conditions that favour PCI by day (tree shade, soil wetness) retard PCI growth at night. The present work, which only deals with PCI growth, cannot predict which type of park will be coolest at night. Complete specification of nocturnal PCI magnitude requires knowledge of the PCI at sunset, and this depends on daytime energetics.},

These changes have the potential to alter surface temperature by modifying the energy budget at the land-atmosphere interface. This study reports the seasonally varying temperature responses of four regional climate models (RCMs) - RSM, RegCM3, MM5-CLM3, and DRCM - to conversion of potential natural vegetation to modern land-cover and land-use over a 1-year period. Three of the RCMs supplemented soil moisture, producing large decreases in the August mean (- 1.4 to - 3.1 °C) and maximum (- 2.9 to - 6.1 °C) 2-m air temperatures where natural vegetation was converted to irrigated agriculture. Conversion to irrigated agriculture also resulted in large increases in relative humidity (9{\%} to 36{\%} absolute change). Modeled changes in the August minimum 2-m air temperature were not as pronounced or consistent across the models. Converting natural vegetation to urban land-cover produced less pronounced temperature effects in all models, with the magnitude of the effect dependent upon the preexisting vegetation type and urban parameterizations. Overall, the RCM results indicate that the temperature impacts of land-use change are most pronounced during the summer months, when surface heating is strongest and differences in surface soil moisture between irrigated land and natural vegetation are largest. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The seasonal variations of concentrations of PAHs in the soil and the air were measured in urban and rural region of Dalian, China in 2007. In soil, mean concentrations of all PAHs in summer were larger than those in winter, whereas the concentrations of heavier weight PAHs in winter were larger than those in summer. Winter/summer concentration ratios for individual PAHs (R(W/S)) increased with the increase of molecular weight of PAHs in soil, indicating that PAHs with high molecular weight were more easily deposited to soil in winter than summer. In air, mean concentrations of all PAHs in winter were larger than those in summer. In comparison with the R(W/S) in soil, all the values of R(W/S) in air were larger than one indicating that the entire individual PAH concentrations in winter were larger than those in summer. The average concentration composition for each PAH compound in soil and air samples was determined and the seasonal change of PAH profile was very small. It was suggested that PAHs in soils and air had the same or similar sources both in winter and summer. The approach to the soil-air equilibrium was assessed by calculating fugacity quotients between soil and air using the soil and air concentrations. The calculated soil-air fugacity quotients indicated that soil acted as a secondary source to the atmosphere for all lighter weight PAHs (two-three rings) and it will continue to be a sink for heavier weight PAHs (five-six rings) in the Dalian environment, both in winter and summer. Medium weight PAHs (four-five rings) were close to the soil-air equilibrium and the tendency shifted between soil and air when season or function region changed. The fugacity quotients of PAHs in summer (mean temperature 298 K) were larger than those in winter (mean temperature 273 K), indicating a higher tendency in summer than winter for PAHs to move from soil to air. The variation of ambient conditions such as temperature, rainfall, etc. can influence the movement of PAHs between soil and air. Most of the fugacity quotients of PAHs for the urban sites were larger than that for the rural site both in winter and summer. This phenomenon may be related with that the temperatures in urban sites were higher than those in the rural site because of the urban heat island effect.},

We determined the range of the "cool-island" effect as well as the relationship between vegetation cover and air temperature throughout the year. The temperature difference between urban and green areas was large in summer and small in winter. The maximum air temperature difference was 1.9 °C in July 2007, and the minimum was -0.3 °C in March 2004. The difference was larger during the day than during the night in summer, whereas in winter the opposite relationship was true. However, winter diurnal variation was not particularly noticeable, a behaviour thought to be related to reduced shading by deciduous trees in the green area. During the night, the cooling effect of the green area reached 200-300 m into the urban area. During the day, the cooling effect between August and October 2006 exceeded 300 m and varied widely, although there was no correlation beyond 500 m. The correlation between air temperature and forest-cover ratio within a radius of 200 m from each measurement site was significant from 16:00 to 19:00. There was also a correlation during the night; this correlation was weakest in the early morning.

abstract = {The contrast of vegetation cover in urban and surrounding areas modulates the magnitude of the urban heat island (UHI). This paper examines the seasonal variations of the UHI using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), surface meteorological observations, and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. A distinction is made between the land surface UHI observed by satellite and the near-surface UHI observed by measuring the air temperature. The land surface UHI is found to be high at night throughout the year but drops during the wet season. The daytime UHI is low or even exhibits an urban cool island throughout the year but increases during the wet season. The near-surface air temperature UHI trend is similar to the land surface temperature UHI at night. By day, however, the air temperature UHI remains constant throughout the year. Regression analysis showed that the daytime land surface UHI correlates with the difference in vegetation fraction between the urban and surrounding areas, and, to a lesser extent, with daytime insolation. At night, the UHI correlates with nighttime atmospheric stability and only weakly with differences in vegetation cover and daytime insolation. WRF simulations with the single-layer Urban Canopy Model were initialized with MODIS data, especially for the urban fraction parameter. The simulations correctly represented the distinct seasonal variations of both types of UHIs. The model was used to test the impact of changes in vegetation fraction in the urban area, indicating that increased vegetation would reduce both the land surface UHI and the air temperature UHI at night, as well as the land surface UHI during the daytime.},

Spatially, the density of the built environment was the primary driver of temperature patterns, with local modifying effects of lake proximity and topographic relief. Temporally, wind speed, cloud cover, relative humidity, soil moisture, and snow all influenced UHI intensity, although the magnitude and significance of their effects varied by season and time of day. Seasonally, UHI intensities tended to be higher during the warmer summer months and lower during the colder months. Seasonal trends in monthly average wind speed and cloud cover tracked annual trends in UHI intensity, with clearer, calmer conditions that are conducive to the stronger UHIs being more common during the summer. However, clear, calm summer nights still had higher UHI intensities than clear, calm winter nights, indicating that some background factor, such as vegetation, shifted baseline UHI intensities throughout the year. The authors propose that regional vegetation and snow-cover conditions set seasonal baselines for UHI intensity and that factors like wind and clouds modified daily UHI intensity around that baseline.},

abstract = {A comparison was made between the resultant surface temperatures and sensible heat fluxes of building interfaces calculated by steady-state and transient (implicit) methods. Both procedures used identical environmental (summer and winter) input. For exterior conditions, the results indicated that the correlation between the two methods is sufficiently large, enabling them to be used interchangeably for the spatial analysis of urban canopy layers of entire cities. Using a steady-state approach as a surrogate for unsteady conditions, computer resources can be saved up to a factor of ten. An urban energy budget model (URBAN 3) has been used to demonstrate that the distribution of sensible heat flux and net longwave radiation - the prime causes of urban heat-island generation - was far from the homogeneity assumed in many macroscopic models or even some street-level studies. The individual emanations of reradiation and sensible heat flux showed different diurnal and spatial patterns. Under the input scenarios used, daytime heat islands assumed a 'doughnut' shape in the inner city. It is believed that many of the lower boundary conditions used in macroscopic numerical models are inadequate in light of this study. {\textcopyright} 1980 D. Reidel Publishing Co.},

abstract = {UHI (Urban Heat Island) has become a serious concern within major cities due to the increased threat of climate change over time. As UHI intensifies, the energy consumed in urban areas increases through an increase in the cooling demand, and restricts the overall comfort and quality of life in urban regions. UHI mitigation approaches have been widely studied over the past few decades. However, the work presented here evaluates and compares how cool roof and PCM (Phase Change Materials) based roof technologies may perform as UHI mitigation strategies. Detailed thermal energy simulations were conducted with these two strategies over a range of seven climatic zones within the United States. For each mitigation strategy, five different roof types were chosen for the analysis. The results indicate that a higher albedo led to superior energy saving and UHI mitigation for all types of roofing materials. Also, asphalt roofs produced the best results of all the roof types. It was found that insulation did not play a significant role in the reduction of UHI effects. The maximum TRHG (through roof heat gain) flux was 54{\%} lower for the PCM roof than the cool roof at a wide range of albedo. Similarly, the maximum sensible heat flux for the PCM roof type 40{\%} lower than the cool roof technology for varying albedo.},

abstract = {Together with economic development and accelerated urbanization, the urban population in China has been increasing rapidly, and anthropogenic heat released by large-scale energy consumption in cities is expected to be a vital factor affecting the climate. In this paper, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Urban Canopy Model (UCM) is employed to simulate the regional impacts on climate under the two scenarios: the underlying surface changes due to urbanization (USCU) and anthropogenic heat release (AHR). Three experiments were performed from December 2006 to December 2008. With respect to the USCU, the surface albedo and the available surface soil water decrease markedly. With the inclusion of AHR, the two scenarios give rise to increased surface temperatures over most areas of China. Especially in the urban agglomeration area of the Yangtze River delta, the combination of USCU and AHR could result in an increase of 2°C in the surface air temperature. The influence of AHR on surface air temperature in winter is greater than the influence of USCU without considering any extra sources of heat, but the opposite is found in summer. The combination of USCU and AHR leads to changes in the surface energy budget. They both increase sensible heat flux, but USCU decreases latent heat flux significantly, and AHR increases latent heat flux slightly. Nevertheless, under the influence of these two scenarios, the precipitation increases in some areas, especially in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, while it decreases in other areas, most notably the Yangtze River delta.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations for an anticyclonic summer episode in the Paris area have been performed at the meso-$\gamma$ scale for a 48-hour period, and compared to observations from a dense operational observational network. The meteorological stations have been classified, according to the extent of urbanization of their surroundings, into four classes (central Paris, urban, suburban, and rural). The atmospheric model, coupled with an urban surface scheme, correctly reproduces the temperature (within 1 K from the observations) and humidity. The intense urban heat island during the night is also well represented. Following the validation, the model is used to quantify atmospheric effects of Paris on the boundary layer, through a comparison with a purely rural simulation. At night, the model simulates a neutral or even slightly unstable boundary layer to a depth of 200 m over the city. In contrast, a very stable layer formed in the countryside. During the day, the boundary layer was more turbulent and 500 m deeper over Paris; vertical velocities of up to 1 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} were created over the city. This leads to an urban breeze with convergence at low levels (with winds around 5 to 7 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}), and divergence at the boundary-layer top (with similar wind speeds). The horizontal extent of the breeze reaches for more than 50 km from the city centre, and could have an important impact on pollutant diffusion in the area for calm days. Finally, three other spring cases are presented briefly. These show that an urban breeze develops if the synoptic wind is weak enough or disorganized; an urban plume develops otherwise.},

A street is chosen that satisfieds many of the model's requirements and a measurement scheme is devised to measure variables which are also simulated. The model is run using input information collected from the field and the data produced are compared with the measured data. The results indicate that the model is capable of simulating many of the climate attributes (such as surface temperatures and net radiation at the canyon top) accurately, but does not simulate the dominant mechanism of sensible heat exchange between the canyon and its environment. Nevertheless, the model predicts a small and largely invariant exchange, similar to that measured. The results of the field study, when compared with other published work, indicates that as street canyons become narrower they become increasingly isolated in terms of heat exchange from the overlying atmosphere. The results of the computer runs appear to follow this pattern. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

The results are tested with extensive sets of non-training measurements and it is found that they correspond well with the actual values. Furthermore, the influence of several input climatic parameters measured at each station, such as solar radiation, daytime and nighttime air temperature, and maximum daily air temperature, on the urban heat island intensity fluctuations is investigated and analyzed separately for the day and nighttime period. From this investigation it is shown that heat island intensity is mainly influenced by urbanization factors.

abstract = {Hong Kong is a high-density sub-tropical city with 7 million people living in an urban area of just over 260 km 2. Tall and closely packed buildings are the common urban morphology. How the urban geometry influences the microclimate in summer daytime is a primary planning concern. The sky view factor (SVF) has been commonly used to indicate the impact of urban geometry on air temperature differences in cities. However, only limited discussions in this aspect have been addressed for daytime course in high-rise and high-density urban environment such as Hong Kong. This paper firstly provides a comprehensive review of SVF analysis in urban climatology studies and then presents a simulation approach to investigate the role of SVF in determining summer daytime intra-urban air temperature differences in urban Hong Kong. An ArcGIS-embedded computer program is developed for calculating continuous SVF values for an entire urban environment and an SVF map is generated. The result is evaluated against meteorological data observed in field measurements. The regression analysis shows that the spatial average of SVF values has a close negative relationship with daytime intra-urban temperature differences. The study indicates that SVF is a significant factor for understanding the microthermal climate in Hong Kong's street canyons. The paper further raises discussions on the application of SVF analysis to urban planning. The study demonstrates that the SVF analysis is a useful and effective tool for planners and urban climatologists conducting studies on high-rise and high-density sub-tropical cities. The understanding can provide support for the development of planning standards and good practice. {\textcopyright} 2010 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The use of highly reflective cool roofing materials can decrease demand for air conditioning, mitigate the urban heat island effect, and potentially slow global warming. However, initially high roof solar reflectance can be degraded by natural soiling and weathering processes. We evaluated solar reflectance losses after three years of natural exposure reported in two separate databases: the Rated Products Directory of the US Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) and information reported by manufacturers to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s ENERGY STAR{\textregistered}rating program. Many product ratings were culled because they were duplicative (within a database) or not measured. A second, site-resolved version of the CRRC dataset was created by transcribing from paper records the site-specific measurements of aged solar reflectance in Florida, Arizona and Ohio. Products with high initial solar reflectance tended to lose reflectance, while those with very low initial solar reflectance tended to become more reflective as they aged. Within the site-resolved CRRC database, absolute solar reflectance losses for samples of medium-to-high initial solar reflectance were 23 times greater in Florida (hot and humid) than in Arizona (hot and dry); losses in Ohio (temperate but polluted) were intermediate. Disaggregating results by product type - factory-applied coating, field-applied coating, metal, modified bitumen, shingle, single-ply membrane and tile - revealed that absolute solar reflectance losses were largest for field-applied coating, modified bitumen and single-ply membrane products, and smallest for factory-applied coating and metal products. The 2008 Title 24 provisional aged solar reflectance formula overpredicts the measured aged solar reflectance of 030{\%} of each product type in the culled public CRRC database. The rate of overprediction was greatest for field-applied coating and single-ply membrane products and least for factory-applied coating, shingle, and metal products. New product-specific formulas of the form $\rho$a′=0. 20$\beta$($\rho$i-0.20) can be used to estimate provisional aged solar reflectance $\rho$a′ from initial solar reflectance $\rho$ipending measurement of aged solar reflectance. The appropriate value of soiling resistance $\beta$ varies by product type and is selected to attain some desired overprediction rate for the formula. The correlations for shingle products presented in this paper should not be used to predict aged solar reflectance or estimate provisional aged solar reflectance because the data set is too small and too limited in range of initial solar reflectance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The urban heat island (UHI) maps were produced using data provided by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board of both Terra and Aqua satellites. Two types of UHI were analyzed simultaneously: the canopy layer heat island (CLHI) and the surface urban heat island (SUHI). The aim of this work is the realization of the SUHI and CLHI maps to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of surface and air heating; also, to highlight and quantify the different features (e.g. magnitude, spatial extent, orientation and UHI center location) a Gaussian surface was used to fit the spatially distributed heat island patterns.The analysis during summer months points out that the SUHI effect is a noticeable phenomenon throughout the whole diurnal cycle: it has a stronger intensity in the daytime with peaks around 9-10. K while in the nighttime, in the absence of solar forcing, it decreases by a factor of 2. In contrast, the canopy layer heat island during the daytime is absent: the CLHI emerges after sunset with an average intensity around 3-4. K, showing features similar to the nighttime SUHI.In addition, comparisons between UHI intensity and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were performed, confirming that green areas can contribute to the mitigation of this phenomenon. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The UHI detection was performed using air temperatures at both the roof and the street levels (using fixed-station and car-traverse measurements) and at the surface level (using an airborne thermal video radiometer [TVR]). Whereas the complex microscale characteristics of the UHI studied by the TVR at the surface level showed variations of up to 10°C, at the street level, air temperature variations of 3-5°C were identified between the city center and the surrounding areas. It was found that during the nighttime, the warm Mediterranean Sea has a moderating effect on the roof-level temperatures, whereas, at the street level, the urban heat island is more pronounced. The combined method of monitoring the UHI from different levels and on different scales for the first time enabled a spatial assessment of the city's UHI and its diverse thermal coverage characteristics. The thermal differences of neighborhoods, urban activity and urban components were compared. It was demonstrated that the city cover plays an important role in the thermal activity of Tel-Aviv. A similar UHI spatial pattern was obtained using isotherm maps, generated from the air temperatures at street level, and thermal images, generated by the TVR at the surface level. It was concluded that there are differences in the magnitude of the UHI at different levels of the canopy layer and at different times, but the UHI pattern has similar trends.

abstract = {Past studies focused on the relationships between land cover and urban temperature have commonly assumed stationarity and used conventional (global) regression analysis. In this study, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used to test the spatial stationarity of the relationships between a set of land cover types (built-up, water, paddy field, and other vegetation) and the surface temperature in TaoYuan, Taiwan. By adopting the GWR approach, significant spatial non-stationarity of these relationships was observed and the strength of these relationships was markedly higher than from a conventional regression analysis. The differences have large impacts. If the regression models were used to derive an estimate of the urban heat island intensity for TaoYuan this would equate to 2.63 °C and 3.17 °C for the global and GWR models, respectively. This result showed that the urban heat island was underestimated by global model and this, therefore, increased potential to underestimate the risk of ill-health and discomfort for urban populations. The mapped parameters derived from GWR analyses provided useful information for planning temperature mitigation and adaptation strategies especially for the very young and elderly that are particularly sensitive to temperature. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The urban heat island describes the phenomenon that air/surface temperatures are higher in urban areas compared to their surrounding rural areas. Numerous studies have shown that increased percent cover of greenspace (PLAND) can significantly decrease land surface temperatures (LST). Fewer studies, however, have investigated the effects of configuration of greenspace on LST. This paper aims to fill this gap using Beijing, China as a case study. PLAND along with six configuration metrics were used to measure the composition and configuration of greenspace. The metrics were calculated based on a greenspace map derived from SPOT imagery, and LST data were retrieved from Landsat TM thermal band. Ordinary least squares regression and spatial autoregression were employed to investigate the relationship between LST and spatial pattern of greenspace using the census tract as the analytical unit. The results showed that PLAND was the most important predictor of LST. A 10 {\%} increase in PLAND resulted in approximately a 0.86 A degrees C decrease in LST. Configuration of greenspace also significantly affected LST. Given a fixed amount of greenspace, LST increased significantly with increased patch density. In addition, the variance of LST was largely explained by both composition and configuration of greenspace. The unique variation explained by the composition was relatively small, and was close to that of the configuration. Results from this study can expand our understanding of the relationship between LST and vegetation, and provide insights for improving urban greenspace planning and management.},

abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) is a mounting problem in built-up areas, leading to increased temperatures, air pollution, and energy consumption. This paper explores the urban determinants of the UHI, using two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) urban information as input to spatial statistical models. The research involves: (a) estimating land surface temperatures, using satellite images, (b) developing a 3-D city model with LiDAR data, (c) generating urban parameters with 2-D/3-D geospatial information, and (d) conducting spatial regression analyses. The data are captured over three grids of square cells - 480. m, 240. m, and 120. m - and characterize the center of Columbus, Ohio. The results show that solar radiations, open spaces, vegetation, building roof-top areas, and water strongly impact surface temperatures, and that spatial regressions are necessary to capture neighboring effects. The best regression is obtained with the general spatial model (GSM), which is then used to simulate the temperature effects of different greening scenarios (green roofs, greened parking and vacant lots, vegetation densification) in the center of Columbus. The results demonstrate the potential of such models to mitigate the UHI through design and land-use policies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Within the framework of a French nationally funded project (CO2-MEGAPARIS) for quantifying the CO2emissions of the Paris area, a lidar-based experimental investigation of the variability of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) depths was performed over four days in March 2011 under clear sky conditions. The prevailing synoptic settings were mainly characterized by anti-cyclonic situations with low wind. The key aim of this paper is to assess the impact of the urban heat island intensity (UHII) on the spatio-temporal variability of the ABL depths over the Paris megacity. A network of fixed aerosol lidars was deployed inside the city and in the vicinity of sub-urban and rural areas. Additionally, the spatial heterogeneity of the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) depths over greater Paris area is addressed, thanks in particular, to the deployment of a 355-nm elastic lidar in a mobile van to measure the aerosol distributions. Radiosonde-derived profiles (twice a day) of thermodynamic variables over the sub-urban site helped investigate the temperature inversion above ground and hence to compare the lidar-derived ABL depths. Comparing these two results, an excellent concordance was found with a correlation coefficient of 0.994.Five important factors closely related to the ABL circulation, namely, spatio-temporal variability of the ABL depths, growth rate of the ABL depths, entrainment zone thickness, and near-surface temperature fields including resultant UHII were considered to infer the urban-rural contrasts. The mean NBL depth over the urban area was on average 63 m (45{\%}) higher than its adjacent sub-urban area which was, on occasion, as much as (74 m) 58{\%} higher mainly due to the effect of UHII. Daytime well-mixed convective boundary layer and associated strong turbulent mixing near its top over the urban area showed higher entrainment zone thickness (326 m) than over sub-urban (234 m) and rural (200 m) areas. Temperature growth rates during sunrise increased up to more than 3 °C h-1over the sub-urban area while over the urban region it was 2.5 °C h-1or even less. The ABL depths over the urban site decayed more slowly (500 m h-1) than over the sub-urban area (600 m h-1) during the late afternoon transition period suggesting an impact of the UHII on the ABL dynamics over the urban area. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Most studies examining the temperature-mortality association in a city used temperatures from one site or the average from a network of sites. This may cause measurement error as temperature varies across a city due to effects such as urban heat islands. We examined whether spatiotemporal models using spatially resolved temperatures produced different associations between temperature and mortality compared with time series models that used non-spatial temperatures. We obtained daily mortality data in 163 areas across Brisbane city, Australia from 2000 to 2004. We used ordinary kriging to interpolate spatial temperature variation across the city based on 19 monitoring sites. We used a spatiotemporal model to examine the impact of spatially resolved temperatures on mortality. Also, we used a time series model to examine non-spatial temperatures using a single site and the average temperature from three sites. We used squared Pearson scaled residuals to compare model fit. We found that kriged temperatures were consistent with observed temperatures. Spatiotemporal models using kriged temperature data yielded slightly better model fit than time series models using a single site or the average of three sites' data. Despite this better fit, spatiotemporal and time series models produced similar associations between temperature and mortality. In conclusion, time series models using non-spatial temperatures were equally good at estimating the city-wide association between temperature and mortality as spatiotemporal models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Streams draining urban heat islands tend to be hotter than rural and forested streams at baseflow because of warmer urban air and ground temperatures, paved surfaces, and decreased riparian canopy. Urban infrastructure efficiently routes runoff over hot impervious surfaces and through storm drains directly into streams and can lead to rapid, dramatic increases in temperature. Thermal regimes affect habitat quality and biogeochemical processes, and changes can be lethal if temperatures exceed upper tolerance limits of aquatic fauna. In summer 2009, we collected continuous (10-min interval) temperature data in 60 streams spanning a range of development intensity in the Piedmont of North Carolina, USA. The 5 most urbanized streams averaged 21.1°C at baseflow, compared to 19.5°C in the 5 most forested streams. Temperatures in urban streams rose as much as 4°C during a small regional storm, whereas the same storm led to extremely small to no changes in temperature in forested streams. Over a kilometer of stream length, baseflow temperature varied by as much as 10°C in an urban stream and as little as 2°C in a forested stream. We used structural equation modeling to explore how reach- and catchment-scale attributes interact to explain maximum temperatures and magnitudes of storm-flow temperature surges. The best predictive model of baseflow temperatures (R2 = 0.461) included moderately strong pathways directly (extent of development and road density) and indirectly, as mediated by reach-scale factors (canopy closure and stream width), from catchment-scale factors. The strongest influence on storm-flow temperature surges appeared to be {\%} development in the catchment. Reach-scale factors, such as the extent of riparian forest and stream width, had little mitigating influence (R2 = 0.448). Stream temperature is an essential, but overlooked, aspect of the urban stream syndrome and is affected by reach-scale habitat variables, catchment-scale urbanization, and stream thermal regimes.},

abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI), a common phenomenon in which surface temperatures are higher in urban areas than in surrounding rural areas, represents one of the most significant human-induced changes to Earth's surface climate1, 2. Even though they are localized hotspots in the landscape, UHIs have a profound impact on the lives of urban residents, who comprise more than half of the world's population3. A barrier to UHI mitigation is the lack of quantitative attribution of the various contributions to UHI intensity4 (expressed as the temperature difference between urban and rural areas, $\Delta$T). A common perception is that reduction in evaporative cooling in urban land is the dominant driver of $\Delta$T (ref. 5). Here we use a climate model to show that, for cities across North America, geographic variations in daytime $\Delta$T are largely explained by variations in the efficiency with which urban and rural areas convect heat to the lower atmosphere. If urban areas are aerodynamically smoother than surrounding rural areas, urban heat dissipation is relatively less efficient and urban warming occurs (and vice versa). This convection effect depends on the local background climate, increasing daytime $\Delta$T by 3.0 ± 0.3 kelvin (mean and standard error) in humid climates but decreasing $\Delta$T by 1.5 ± 0.2 kelvin in dry climates. In the humid eastern United States, there is evidence of higher $\Delta$T in drier years. These relationships imply that UHIs will exacerbate heatwave stress on human health in wet climates where high temperature effects are already compounded by high air humidity6, 7 and in drier years when positive temperature anomalies may be reinforced by a precipitation–temperature feedback8. Our results support albedo management as a viable means of reducing $\Delta$T on large scales9, 10.},

abstract = {This study examines the influence of urban and topoclimatic factors on the temperature field of Stolberg, Germany, a densely built up town in a valley, on the basis of stationary and mobile measurements during cloudless and nearly calm weather conditions. Qualitative and quantitative statements are made about the extent of influence by invariable parameters (percentage of sealed area, height) and by variable conditions (wind velocity, time, temperature amplitude) on thermal conditions in the investigated area. An observed influence of cold air on the temperature field near the ground required further study of wind field influences due to topographic conditions and of an analysis of intensity and frequency of valley inversions. Regarding clear and calm weather conditions, results show a significant relationship between thermal conditions and the percentage of sealed area, as well as topographical height. As a result of roughness of the built up area, the nocturnal urban excess temperature is not reduced by cold air drainage until the second half of the night. The high production of cold air causes the nocturnal component of a mountain and valley wind regime, which explains the accelerated cold air transport from above the urban canopy layer as well as the frequency of valley inversions. While ground level inversions exist in the rural area of the valley, the urban heat island effect causes an inversion at a higher level above the developed valley area.},

abstract = {Singapore is a Garden City. On the other hand, with increasing population and limited territory, the government had to adopt a high-density and high-rise residential strategy. The high concentration of buildings in cities has resulted in many environmental issues, such as the Urban Heat Island effect. The rising ecological concerns for building design attempt to create harmony between buildings and their surroundings through mitigating their negative impact on the environment. The greening of buildings is essentially one of the ecological measures. The National Parks Board (NParks) launched a skyrise greenery approach/programme recently to promote the greening of buildings. To explore the thermal benefits, a before and after measurement and an experiment were carried out. The green roof tends to experience lower surface temperature than the original exposed roof surface, especially in areas well covered by vegetation. A maximum temperature difference of 18 °C was observed. However, the substrate temperature measured can exceed the surface temperature of the original exposed roof when the substrate is very dry. In areas that tend to be sparsely covered by vegetation, the peak temperature recorded was up to 73.4 °C during the day time. Ambient air temperature, correspondingly, at 300 mm above the substrate surface can reach 40 °C. This is worsened by the lower wind speed recorded after the measurements. The resulting substrate moisture, when the green roof systems are well covered by vegetation, will tend to keep substrate temperature lower than the original exposed bare roof. The heat flux through the roof structure was greatly reduced due to the installation of extensive systems. Maximally, over 60{\%} of heat gain was stopped by the system. The impact of different types of vegetation may vary as well. Those with relatively extensive greenery coverage led to better thermal performance. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

CFD simulations performed in order to calculate surface temperature in buildings' facades and at street level as well as air temperature inside the canyon. On the first part of this study comparison carried out between the measured and calculated values for a) surface temperature for the initial coating and b) the air temperature in the center of a deep street urban canyon. The calculated data have been thoroughly analyzed and used as well for the CFD model validation. The second task of this work was the calculation of the surface and air temperature, inside the deep urban canyon, by using a "cool" coating and the possible mitigation of the heat island effect in the specific urban area. The use of "cool" coatings, providing high reflectivity of solar radiation on the materials used on pavements and walls inside a canyon, estimated able to decrease surface temperature up to 7-8°C at ground level. The decrease on walls' surface temperature estimated close to 2-3°C. Ambient air temperature inside the urban street canyon may decrease up to 1 °C. The reduction of absorbed solar radiation may lead to the energy consumption and thermal comfort conditions in cities and fight the increased heat island effect. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cool roofs represent an acknowledged passive cooling technique to reduce building energy consumption for cooling and to mitigate urban heat island effects. This paper concerns the evaluation of the dynamic effect of new cool roof clay tiles on building thermal performance in summer and winter conditions. To this end, these properties have been analyzed on traditional roof brick tiles through an indoor and outdoor two-year long continuous monitoring campaign set up in a residential building located in central Italy. The analysis and the cooperation with industrial companies producing brick tiles and reflective coatings allowed the production of a new tile with notable “cool roof” properties through the traditional industrial manufacturing path of such tiles. Notable results show that during summer the high reflection tiles are able to decrease the average external roof surface temperature by more than 10 °C and the indoor operative temperature by more than 3 °C. During winter the average external surface temperature is lower with high reflection tiles by about 1 °C. Singular optic-thermal phenomena are registered while evaluating the dynamics of the cool roof effect. Interesting findings show how the sloped cool roof application could suggest further considerations about the dynamic effect of cool roofs.},

abstract = {Efforts characterizing the changing climate of southwestern North America by focusing exclusively on the impacts of in- creasing levels of long-lived greenhouse gases omit funda- mental elements with similar order-of-magnitude impacts as those owing to large-scale climate change1,2. Using a suite of ensemble-based, multiyear simulations, here we show the intensification of observationally based urban-induced phe- nomena and demonstrate that the direct summer-time climate effects of the most rapidly expanding megapolitan region in the USA—Arizona's Sun Corridor—are considerable. Although urban-induced warming approaches 4◦C locally for the max- imum expansion scenario, impacts depend on the particular trajectory of development. Cool-roof implementation reduces simulated warming by about 50{\%}, yet decreases in summer- time evapotranspiration remain at least as large as those from urban expansion without this mode of adaptation. The contribution of urban-induced warming relative to mid- and end-of-century climate change illustrates strong dependence on built environment expansion scenarios and emissions path- ways. Our results highlight the direct climate impacts that result from newly emerging megapolitan regions and their significance for overcoming present challenges concerning sus- tainable development3,4.

abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) is a major anthropogenic alteration on Earth environments and its geospatial pattern remains poorly understood over large areas. Using MODIS data from 2003 to 2011, we quantified the diurnal and seasonal surface UHI intensity (SUHII, urban-suburban temperature difference) in China's 32 major cities, and analyzed their spatial variations and possible underlying mechanisms. Results show that the annual mean SUHII varied markedly from 0.01 to 1.87. °C in the day and 0.35 to 1.95. °C at night, with a great deal of spatial heterogeneities. Higher SUHIIs for the day and night were observed in the southeastern and northern regions, respectively. Moreover, the SUHII differed greatly by season, characterized by a higher intensity in summer than in winter during the day, and the opposite during the night for most cities. Consequently, whether the daytime SUHII was higher or lower than the nighttime SUHII for a city depends strongly on the geographic location and research period. The SUHII's distribution in the day related closely to vegetation activity and anthropogenic heat releases in summer, and to climate (temperature and precipitation) in winter, while that at night linked tightly to albedo, anthropogenic heat releases, built-up intensity, and climate in both seasons. Overall, we found the overwhelming control of climate on the SUHII's spatial variability, yet the factors included in this study explained a much smaller fraction of the SUHII variations in the day compared to night and in summer relative to winter (day vs. night: 57{\%} vs. 72{\%} in summer, and 61{\%} vs. 90{\%} in winter, respectively), indicating more complicated mechanisms underlying the distribution of daytime SUHII, particularly in summer. Our results highlight the different diurnal (day and night) and seasonal (summer and winter) SUHII's spatial patterns and driving forces, suggesting various strategies are needed for an effective UHI effect mitigation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Relationships between sources and levels of particulate matter and climatic parameters (urban heat island intensity, wind speed, temperature and relative humidity) were investigated in the coastal city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's largest city. Measurements were made during the wet and dry seasons of 2001 at an urban and a rural site. Five elements were used to represent different sources: K in fine particles (biomass), Zn in fine particles (industry), Cl in coarse particles (sea spray), Ti in coarse particles (soil) and Pb in fine particles (traffic). The concentrations of these elements varied considerably between the urban and rural site during both the wet and dry season, with the urban site in the dry season having the highest concentrations. Diurnal differences are also apparent, although not as straightforward. In an attempt to explain these differences, correlations between all elements and the climatic parameters were investigated. The results show that the nocturnal urban heat island intensity was positively correlated and wind speed negatively correlated with particulate levels, presumably due to the increased atmospheric stability. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {AbstractCities are well known to be hotter than the rural areas that surround them; this phenomenon is called the urban heat island. Heat waves are excessively hot periods during which the air temperatures of both urban and rural areas increase significantly. However, whether urban and rural temperatures respond in the same way to heat waves remains a critical unanswered question. In this study, a combination of observational and modeling analyses indicates synergies between urban heat islands and heat waves. That is, not only do heat waves increase the ambient temperatures, but they also intensify the difference between urban and rural temperatures. As a result, the added heat stress in cities will be even higher than the sum of the background urban heat island effect and the heat wave effect. Results presented here also attribute this added impact of heat waves on urban areas to the lack of surface moisture in urban areas and the low wind speed associated with heat waves.

abstract = {Although meteorological stations provide accurate air temperature observations, their spatial coverage is limited and thus often insufficient for epidemiological studies. Satellite data expand spatial coverage, enhancing our ability to estimate near surface air temperature (Ta). However, the derivation of Ta from surface temperature (Ts) measured by satellites is far from being straightforward. In this study, we present a novel approach that incorporates land use regression, meteorological variables and spatial smoothing to first calibrate between Ts and Ta on a daily basis and then predict Ta for days when satellite Ts data were not available. We applied mixed regression models with daily random slopes to calibrate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Ts data with monitored Ta measurements for 2003. Then, we used a generalized additive mixed model with spatial smoothing to estimate Ta in days with missing Ts. Out-of-sample tenfold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. Our model performance was excellent for both days with available Ts and days without Ts observations (mean out-of-sample R2=0.946 and R2=0.941 respectively). Furthermore, based on the high quality predictions we investigated the spatial patterns of Ta within the study domain as they relate to urban vs. non-urban land uses. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper reports on temporal and spatial variability of local climate and outdoor human thermal comfort within the Rotterdam agglomeration. We analyse three years of meteorological observations (2010-2012) from a monitoring network. Focus is on the atmospheric urban heat island (UHI); the difference in air temperature between urban areas and rural surroundings. In addition, we calculate the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) which is a measure of thermal comfort. Subsequently, we determine the dependency of intra-urban variability in local climate and PET on urban land-use and geometric characteristics. During a large part of the year, UHI-intensities in densely built areas can be considerable, under calm and clear (cloudless) weather conditions. The highest maximum UHI-values are found in summer, with 95-percentile values ranging from 4.3K to more than 8K, depending on the location. In winter, UHI-intensities are generally lower. Intra-urban variability in maximum UHI-intensity is considerable, indicating that local features have an important influence. It is found to be significantly related to building, impervious and green surface fractions, respectively, as well as to mean building height.In summer, urban areas show a larger number of discomfort hours (PET{\textgreater}23°C) compared to the reference rural area. Our results indicate that this is mainly related to the much lower wind velocities in urban areas. Also intra-urban variability in thermal comfort during daytime appears to be mainly related to differences in wind velocity. After sunset, the UHI effect plays a more prominent role and hence thermal comfort is more related with urban characteristics.},

The surface air temperature data (mean, maximum, and minimum) from one urban (down- town Beijing) and one rural (70km from downtown Beijing) station were used for the period 1977 and 2000. It is found that the temperatures in both urban and rural stations show an increasing tendency. Specifically, mini- mum temperature shows the greatest tendency at the urban station whereas maximum temperature shows the greatest increase at the rural station. The UHI intensity obtained by calculating the difference in temperatures between the two stations identifies that the intensity is greatest and has the greatest increasing trend for minimum temperature, while the UHI intensity of maximum temperature shows a slow decrease over time. UHI intensity for minimum temperature has a strong positive correlation with the increase in the urban population and the expansion of the yearly construc- tion area. Seasonal analyses showed the UHI intensity is strongest in winter. This seasonal UHI variation tends to be negatively correlated with the seasonal variation of relative humidity and vapor pressure. Hourly variation reveals that the strongest UHI intensity is observed in the late nighttime or evening, while the weakest is observed during the day.},

Although the observations have been continuous since 1775, the period 1901-97 with the most credible data is mainly examined. Most of the warmest summers of the 20th century appeared within the periods 1943-52 and 1992-95; the temporal distribution of heat waves corresponds to this pattern and shows two maxima, in the 1940s to early 1950s and in the 1990s. A very low occurrence of heat waves was typical of the beginning of the 20th century and around 1980. The peak of heat wave severity in the 1940s-early 1950s, as well as their almost total absence in the first two decades of the 20th century, may be a common feature for a large area, as indicated by the comparison between two stations within central Europe, Prague-Klementinum and Basel (Switzerland), and by other studies. An extraordinary heat wave occurred in July and August 1994. It greatly exceeded other heat waves, mainly in the much higher cumulative temperature excess above 30degreesC and a record-breaking duration of a continuous period of tropical days. Relationships between heat wave characteristics in warm and cold decades and circulation conditions were analysed using the subjective Hess-Brezowsky catalogue of weather types (Grosswetterlagen). The link to the atmospheric circulation is evident, e.g. situations with an anticyclone or a ridge over central Europe were more (less) frequent during all the warm (cold) decades. Moreover, the occurrence of long and severe heat waves in the 1990s may reflect an enhanced persistence of the atmospheric circulation over Europe in the summer season because all groups of weather types have considerably increased residence times in 1988-97 compared with long-term means.

abstract = {Green areas in the urban environment can contribute to the mitigation of the Urban Heat Island. In a context of climate change, with the expected increase in temperature, dryness and intensity of heat waves, green areas assume even higher importance as they can create a cooling effect that extends to the surrounding areas. This study analyses the thermal performance of a small green space (0.24 ha) and its influence in the surrounding atmospheric environment of a densely urbanised area in Lisbon. Measurements of weather parameters (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar and infrared radiation) were carried out along a selected path, starting from inside the green area to surrounding streets with different orientations and solar exposure. It was found that the garden was cooler than the surrounding areas, either in the sun or in the shade. These differences were higher in hotter days and particularly related to the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt). The highest difference found was of 6.9 °C in relation to air temperature and 39.2 °C in relation to Tmrt; in both cases this difference occurred between the shaded site inside the garden and the sunny site in an E-W oriented street in the southern part of the studied area. Besides the local weather conditions, particularly the low wind speed, the sun exposure and the urban geometry are the potential factors that explain these differences. The cooling effect of green areas on the surrounding environment can be enhanced by additional measures related to the urban features of each city. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, the environmental benefits of cooling provided by urban green spaces have rarely been measured. In this paper, we estimated the energy-savings and emission-reduction contribution of urban green spaces in Beijing, applying a empirical model. Our calculations suggest urban green spaces play a major role in reducing energy demand and increasing CO2sequestration. Urbanized Beijing has 16,577ha of green space which could absorb 3.33×1012kJ of heat via evapotranspiration during the entire summer. The cooling effect reduced the air conditioning demand by 3.09×108kWh which amounts to a 60{\%} reduction in net cooling energy usage in Beijing. The annual reduction in CO2emissions from power plants associated with electricity saving would reach 243 thousand tons with an average of 61kg/(haday). Also, the cooling effect and the environmental benefits of urban green space in Beijing largely depend on the green space's structure and size. Urban managers and landscape planners should take advantage of this research to plan, design and manage green spaces in heat island areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper describes a climatic analysis of landscape strategies for outdoor cooling in a hot-arid region, considering the efficiency of water use. Six landscape strategies were studied, using different combinations of trees, lawn, and an overhead shade mesh. The effects of these treatments were tested during the summer season in two semi-enclosed courtyards located at an urban settlement in the arid Negev Highlands of southern Israel. Compared to a non-vegetated exposed courtyard, which on average reached a maximum air temperature of 34 °C in mid-afternoon, a similar courtyard treated with shade trees and grass yielded a daytime temperature depression of up to 2.5 K, while shading the courtyard with a fabric shading mesh, counter-intuitively, caused a relative increase of nearly 1 K. Unshaded grass was found to cause only a small air temperature depression and had the highest water requirement. However when the grass was shaded, either by the trees or by the shade mesh, a synergic effect produced greater cooling as well as a reduction of more than 50{\%} in total water use. The "cooling efficiency" of these strategies was calculated as the ratio between the sensible heat removed from the space and the latent heat of evaporation, with the latter representing the amount of water required for landscape irrigation. This measure is proposed as a criterion for evaluating landscape strategies in arid regions, where water resources are scarce. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Domestic gardens provide a significant component of urban green infrastructure but their relative contribution to eco-system service provision remains largely un-quantified. 'Green infrastructure' itself is often ill-defined, posing problems for planners to ascertain what types of green infrastructure provide greatest benefit and under what circumstances. Within this context the relative merits of gardens are unclear; however, at a time of greater urbanization where private gardens are increasingly seen as a 'luxury', it is important to define their role precisely. Hence, the nature of this review is to interpret existing information pertaining to gardens/gardening . per se, identify where they may have a unique role to play and to highlight where further research is warranted. The review suggests that there are significant differences in both form and management of domestic gardens which radically influence the benefits. Nevertheless, gardens can play a strong role in improving the environmental impact of the domestic curtilage, e.g. by insulating houses against temperature extremes they can reduce domestic energy use. Gardens also improve localized air cooling, help mitigate flooding and provide a haven for wildlife. Less favourable aspects include contributions of gardens and gardening to greenhouse gas emissions, misuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and introduction of alien plant species. Due to the close proximity to the home and hence accessibility for many, possibly the greatest benefit of the domestic garden is on human health and well-being, but further work is required to define this clearly within the wider context of green infrastructure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

Generally, a 'V'-shaped (equivalent) temperature-mortality curve with increasing mortality at low and high temperatures was observed. Particularly, urban areas suffered from heat-related mortality with a steep increase above a specific threshold.

Stack ventilation was investigated as the most suitable night ventilation strategy because this is largely independent of wind variations affected by local urban morphology. The paper presents a summary of the results of air temperature measurements carried out in London in 1999/2000 which were used to quantify the London Urban Heat Island Intensity. It then presents data for two representative weeks, one with extreme hot weather and one with typical hot weather in the centre of the London heat island and a rural reference site. These data are used to carry out a parametric analysis by using a thermal and air flow simulation tool specifically designed for offices in SE England. A reference and optimised office module are described. A comparison of the building types based in the same location suggests that during the typical hot week the rural reference office has 84{\%} energy demand for cooling compared to a similar urban office. A rural optimised office would not need any artificial cooling and would be able to maintain temperatures below 24 °C. An urban optimised office would not be able to achieve this. A rural optimised office would need 42{\%} of the cooling required for an optimised urban office. A comparison of the optimised to the reference office module suggests that an urban optimised office reduces the cooling demand to 10{\%} of the urban reference office. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The process of urbanisation alters the thermal balance of an area resulting in an urban heat island effect where cities can be several degrees centigrade warmer than the surrounding rural landscape. This increased heat can make cities uncomfortable places and, during heat waves, can pose serious health risks. This study looked at the role that trees and grass can play in reducing regional and local temperatures in urban areas during the summer within the urban landscape of Manchester, UK. In June and July 2009 and 2010, we monitored the surface temperatures of small plots composed of concrete and grass in the presence or absence of tree shading, and measured globe temperatures above each of the surfaces. The same measures were also recorded at mid-day on larger expanses of asphalt and grass in an urban park. Both surface and shade greatly affected surface temperatures. Grass reduced maximum surface temperatures by up to 24°C, similar to model predictions, while tree shade reduced them by up to 19°C. In contrast, surface composition had little effect upon globe temperatures, whereas shading reduced them by up to 5-7°C. These results show that both grass and trees can effectively cool surfaces and so can provide regional cooling, helping reduce the urban heat island in hot weather. In contrast grass has little effect upon local air or globe temperatures, so should have little effect on human comfort, whereas tree shade can provide effective local cooling. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {We assessed how small patches of contrasting urban ground cover [mesiscape (turf), xeriscape (gravel), concrete, and asphalt] altered the microclimate and performance of adjacent oleander (Nerium oleander L.) plants in Phoenix, Arizona during fall/winter (September-February) and spring/summer (March-September). Ground-cover and oleander canopy surface temperatures, canopy air temperatures and pot soil temperatures tended to be lowest in the mesiscape and highest in the asphalt and concrete. Canopy air vapor pressure deficits were lowest in the mesiscape and highest in the asphalt plot. Rates of net photosynthesis of all oleander plants were highest in October and May, and declined through mid-summer (June-July), when rates tended to be highest in the cooler mesiscape, particularly when water was limiting. During fall/winter, oleanders in the mesiscape produced 20{\%} less biomass, 13{\%} less leaf area, and had 12{\%} lower relative growth rates (R(G)) than those in the other ground covers. Lower nighttime temperatures in the mesiscape in December led to oleander frost damage. During spring/summer, oleanders in the mesiscape produced 11{\%} more biomass, 16{\%} more leaf area, and had 3{\%} higher R(G) than those in the other cover types. The effects of urban ground cover on oleander performance were season-specific; while oleander growth was greatest in the mesiscape during spring/summer, it was lowest during fall/winter and these plants experienced frost damage. Because all oleander plants produced {\textgreater}10 times as much biomass during the spring/summer, on an annual basis oleanders in the mesiscape produced 5-11{\%} more biomass than plants in the warmer ground covers.},

abstract = {Mitigation of the urban heat island (UHI) effect at the city-scale is investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in conjunction with the Princeton Urban Canopy Model (PUCM). Specifically, the cooling impacts of green roof and cool (white/highalbedo) roof strategies over the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area during a heat wave period (7 June–10 June 2008) are assessed using the optimal set-up of WRF-PUCM described in the companion paper by Li and Bou-Zeid (2014). Results indicate that the surface UHI effect (defined based on the urban–rural surface temperature difference) is reduced significantly more than the near-surface UHI effect (defined based on urban–rural 2 m air temperature difference) when these mitigation strategies are adopted. In addition, as the green and cool roof fractions increase, the surface and near-surface UHIs are reduced almost linearly. Green roofs with relatively abundant soil moisture have comparable effect in reducing the surface and near-surface UHIs to cool roofs with an albedo value of 0.7. Significant indirect effects are also observed for both green and cool roof strategies; mainly, the low-level advection of atmospheric moisture from rural areas into urban terrain is enhanced when the fraction of these roofs increases, thus increasing the humidity in urban areas. The additional benefits or penalties associated with modifications of the main physical determinants of green or cool roof performance are also investigated. For green roofs, when the soil moisture is increased by irrigation, additional cooling effect is obtained, especially when the ‘unmanaged' soil moisture is low. The effects of changing the albedo of cool roofs are also substantial. These results also underline the capabilities of the WRF-PUCM framework to support detailed analysis and diagnosis of the UHI phenomenon, and of its different mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the effects of land-use and anthropogenically produced heat on the surface air temperature in the Tokyo Metropolitan area, numerical experiments were carried out under typical summer synoptic conditions. The model is based on the three-dimensional Boussinesq equations, taking into account the hydrostatic assumption. Since land-use differs over every subdivision in Tokyo, the model includes a sub-grid parametrization scheme which can calculate the total heat flux a grid surface composed of different surfaces. The diurnal variation of the simulated surface air temperature agrees well with the observed value; an average over 36 days which represent typical summer days; i.e. negligible gradient winds and almost clear skies. The model shows that the contribution of anthropogenic heat is much larger at night, in spite of the lower energy consumption as compared to daytime use. Due to the scarcity of green vegetated areas in the central part of the city, the surface air temperature is enhanced in this region during daytime, however this enhancement is small after midnight. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {One mechanism for climate change is the collected impact of changes in land cover or land use. Such changes are especially significant in urban areas where much of the world's population lives. Satellite observations provide a basis for characterizing the physical modifications that result from urbanization. In particular, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Terra satellite measures surface spectral albedos, thermal emissivities, and radiative temperatures. A better understanding of these measurements should improve our knowledge of the climate impact of urbanization as well as our ability to specify the parameters needed by climate models to compute the impacts of urbanization. For this purpose, it is useful to contrast urban areas with neighboring nonurban surfaces with regard to their radiative surface temperatures, emissivities, and albedos. Among these properties, surface temperatures have been most extensively studied previously in the context of the " urban heat island " (UHI). Nevertheless, except for a few detailed studies, the UHI has mostly been characterized in terms of surface air temperatures. To provide a global analysis, the zonal average of these properties are presented here measured over urban areas versus neighboring nonurban areas. Furthermore, individual cities are examined to illustrate the variations of these variables with land cover under different climate conditions [e.g., in Beijing, New York, and Phoenix (a desert city of the United States)]. Satellite-measured skin temperatures are related to the surface air temperatures but do not necessarily have the same seasonal and diurnal variations, since they are more coupled to surface energy exchange processes and less to the overlying atmospheric column. Consequently, the UHI effects from skin temperature are shown to be pronounced at both daytime and nighttime, rather than at night as previously suggested from surface air temperature measurements. In addition, urban areas are characterized by albedos much lower than those of croplands and deciduous forests in summer but similar to those of forests in winter. Thus, urban surfaces can be distinguished from nonurban surfaces through use of a proposed index formed by multiplying skin temperature by albedo.},

Our results also suggested that the urban-rural difference in term of minimum tem- perature, with the strongest urban heat island (UHI) effect reaching 0.74K in winter over large city station pairs, showed good ability to capture the UHI effect. The impact of urbanization on air temperature displayed sharp changes since the innovation and opening of China in 1978. The cities with strong UHI effects were mainly located in regions with rapid industrial and the econom- ic development. Cities in the north of China showed a stronger UHI effect than those in the south. The UHI ef- fects were relatively weaker in coastal cities than in inland ones in spring and summer, with the reverses found for autumn and winter.

This leads to a number of problems related to health and well-being of humans and also negatively affects social and commercial outdoor activities. The creation of thermally comfortable microclimates in urban environments is therefore very important. This paper discusses the influence of street-canyon geometry on outdoor thermal comfort in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Five sites with different urban geometry, ground cover, and distance from the sea were studied during the warmest season. The environmental parameters affecting thermal comfort, viz. air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, were measured, and the thermal comfort was estimated by calculating the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). The thermal comfort is far above the assumed comfort zone due to the combination of intense solar radiation, high temperatures, and low wind speeds, especially on clear days. The worst conditions were found in wide streets with low-rise buildings and no shade trees. The most comfortable conditions were found in narrow streets with tall buildings, especially if shade trees were present, as well as in areas near the coast where the sea breeze had a positive effect. In order to improve the outdoor comfort in Colombo, it is suggested to allow a more compact urban form with deeper street canyons and to provide additional shade through the use of trees, covered walkways, pedestrian arcades, etc. The opening up of the city's coastal strip would allow the sea breeze to penetrate further into the city.},

The core of this WRF/urban modelling system consists of the following: (1) three methods with different degrees of freedom to parameterize urban surface processes, ranging from a simple bulk parameterization to a sophisticated multi-layer urban canopy model with an indoor–outdoor exchange sub-model that directly interacts with the atmospheric boundary layer, (2) coupling to fine-scale computational fluid dynamic Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and Large-Eddy simulation models for transport and dispersion (T{\{}{\&}{\}}D) applications, (3) procedures to incorporate high-resolution urban land use, building morphology, and anthropogenic heating data using the National Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (NUDAPT), and (4) an urbanized high-resolution land data assimilation system. This paper provides an overview of this modelling system; addresses the daunting challenges of initializing the coupled WRF/urban model and of specifying the potentially vast number of parameters required to execute the WRF/urban model; explores the model sensitivity to these urban parameters; and evaluates the ability of WRF/urban to capture urban heat islands, complex boundary-layer structures aloft, and urban plume T{\{}{\&}{\}}D for several major metropolitan regions.

Increased surface porosity and bodies of surface water have a role to play in increasing potential cooling through evaporation. Urban rivers may, therefore, have a place in reducing the UHI. This paper investigates the effectiveness that small urban rivers may have in reducing the UHI effect and also examines the role that the urban form on the banks of a river can play in propagating or reducing this potential cooling. The results from a field survey during spring and summer are presented for a river in Sheffield, UK. The level of cooling is related to the ambient air temperature, increasing at higher temperatures. However, there are also seasonal dependencies and relationships linked to the river water temperature, incident solar radiation, wind speed and relative humidity. A mean level of daytime cooling of over 1.5 °C was found above the river in spring, but this was reduced in summer when the river water temperature was warmer. The urban form on the river bank influenced the levels of cooling felt away from the river bank. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A brief but intense heat wave developed in the central and eastern United States in mid-July 1995, causing hundreds of fatalities. The most notable feature of this event was the development of very high dewpoint temperature (Td) over the southern Great Lakes region and the Upper Mississippi River Basin. At many locations, hourly values of Td set new records. The combination of high air and dewpoint temperatures resulted in daily average apparent temperatures exceeding 36°C over a large area on some days. A comparison with past heat waves shows that this was the most intense short-duration heat wave in at least the last 48 years at some locations in the southern Great Lakes region and Upper Mississippi River Basin. An analysis of historical data for Chicago, where the majority of fatalities occurred, indicates the intensity of this heat wave was exceeded only by a few periods in the 1910s and 1930s. Impacts in the Chicago urban center were exacerbated by an urban heat island that raised nocturnal temperatures by more than 2°C. An analysis of radiosonde data indicates that maximum daytime boundary layer mixing depths were only a few hundred meters in the core region of the heat wave. Simulations using a single-column version of a three-dimensional mesoscale model strongly suggest that this contributed to the very high values of Td since soil moisture in the central United States was near to above average and evapotransporation was likely high, causing a rapid moistening of the shallow boundary layer.},

Measured air temperature data have been used as input to a building energy simulation computer program to assess the heating and cooling load of a typical air-conditioned office building positioned at 24 different locations within the London Heat Island. It is found that the urban cooling load is up to 25{\%} higher than the rural load over the year, and the annual heating load is reduced by 22{\%}. The effect of raised temperature and urban context are assessed separately, and the sensitivity of the net impact to the internal gains in a building is determined. For the estimation of peak cooling demand, we propose hourly temperature corrections based on radial distance from London's centre to be applied to standard published temperatures for the region. For more detailed investigations over the cooling season a range of models is available. These are reviewed in this paper and we describe preliminary results of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that predicts location specific hourly temperatures for London, taking into account radial distance from central London, hourly air temperature measured at the meteorological station and associated synoptic weather data. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In a recent analysis for Baton Rouge, Sacramento, and Salt\backslashnLake City, we estimated that planting an average of four shade trees per\backslashnhouse (each with a top view cross section of 50 m(2)) would lead to an\backslashnannual reduction in carbon emissions from power plants of 16,000,\backslashn41,000, and 9000 t, respectively (the per-tree reduction in carbon\backslashnemissions is about 10-11 kg per year). These reductions only account for\backslashnthe direct reduction in the net cooling- and heating-energy use of\backslashnbuildings. Once the impact of the community cooling is included, these\backslashnsavings are increased by at least 25{\%}. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier\backslashnScience Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the benefits on the local microclimate and the building energy saving resulting from green roof retrofits. The research investigates a case study located in a university campus in Toronto, Canada. After completing a detailed energy audit of the building, an assessment of the benefits resulting from the installation of an extensive green roof was performed. A virtual model validated using multiyear data of a local network of different weather stations was used to simulate the effects of the green roof retrofit over the outdoor microclimate. Then, a building energy model was used to compare the energy saving of several green roof designs. Results indicate that increasing the leaf area index (LAI) would lead to an increased cooling effect of the air temperature up to 0.4 °C during the day at pedestrian level, while a more significant temperature reduction would be obtained only at the rooftop level. This confirms the potential of green roofs as urban heat island mitigation strategy. The adoption of a green roof retrofit resulted in a building energy demand reduction by 3{\%}, and in significantly improved indoor comfort levels in the floor below the green roof. Finally, the parametric analysis of different green roof options showed that for building energy savings, increasing the soil depth is more important than increasing the LAI.},

abstract = {The climate of built-up regions differs significantly from rural regions and the most important modifying effect of urbanization on local climate is the urban temperature excess, otherwise called the urban heat island (UHI). This study examines the influence of built-up areas on the near-surface air temperature field in the case of the medium- sized city of Debrecen, Hungary. Mobile measurements were used under different weather conditions between March 2002 and March 2003. Efforts concentrated on the determination of the spatial distribution of mean maximum UHI intensity with special regard to land-use features such as built-up ratio and its areal extensions. In both (heating and non-heating) seasons the spatial distribution of the UHI intensity field showed a basically concentric shape with local anomalies. The mean maximum UHI intensity reaches more than 2.0 °C (heating season) and 2.5 °C (non-heating season) in the centre of the city. We established the relationship between the above-mentioned land-use parameters and mean maximum UHI intensity by means of multiple linear regression analysis. As the measured and predicted mean maximum UHI intensity patterns show, there is an obvious connection between the spatial distribution of urban thermal excess and the land-use parameters examined, so these parameters play a significant role in the development of the strong UHI intensity field over the city.

abstract = {The term urban heat island (UHI) describes a phenomenon where cities are on average warmer than the surrounding rural area. Trees and greenspaces are recognised for their strong potential to regulate urban air temperatures and combat the UHI. Empirical data is required in the UK to inform predictions on cooling by urban greenspaces and guide planning to maximise cooling of urban populations. We describe a 5-month study to measure the temperature profile of one of central London's large greenspaces and also in an adjacent street to determine the extent to which the greenspace reduced night-time UHI intensity. Statistical modelling displayed an exponential decay in the extent of cooling with increased distance from the greenspace. The extent of cooling ranged from an estimated 20. m on some nights to 440. m on other nights. The mean temperature reduction over these distances was 1.1. °C in the summer months, with a maximum of 4. °C cooling observed on some nights. Results suggest that calculation of London's UHI using Met Stations close to urban greenspace can underestimate 'urban' heat island intensity due to the cooling effect of the greenspace and values could be in the region of 45{\%} higher. Our results lend support to claims that urban greenspace is an important component of UHI mitigation strategies. Lack of certainty over the variables that govern the extent of the greenspace cooling influence indicates that the multifaceted roles of trees and greenspaces in the UK's urban environment merit further consideration. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Despite increased recognition of the importance of urban vegetation research, few attempts have been made to assess the relative influence of ecological variables on the species composition of urban wastelands. The main aim of this paper is to assess the relative importance of soil and microclimatic variables in structuring plant species richness and diversity in this habitat. Field investigations were carried out in 22 wasteland sites situated within the city of Brussels. The vegetation has been recorded in 38 4 m2-plots according to the Braun-Blanquet-method. A total of 19 environmental variables were taken into consideration, among others the presence of different kinds of anthropogenic substrates and microclimatic variables. Results indicate that plant species composition in urban wastelands is mainly driven by soil nutrient content, soil moisture, soil pH and light intensity (as inferred by the mean Ellenberg's indicator values). Various types of anthropogenic substrates such as concrete, pebbles, sand and rubble had different effects on the species composition, the proportion of neophytes, hemeroby and urbanity level. Air temperature and humidity did show a significant influence on the presence of some species. The contribution of these environmental variables to the species composition and diversity of urban wastelands is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Death certificate data were analyzed to determine the spatial distribution of excess mortality on days that exceeded the 85th, 90th, and 95th percentiles of apparent temperature. We find that the average statewide mortality anomalies were 5.11, 6.26, and 7.26 deaths on days exceeding the 85th, 90th, and 95th percentiles of apparent temperature respectively. A linear stepwise regression showed that percent African-American population and percent elderly population (those above the age of 65) were positively associated with an MG's mortality anomaly on days exceeding the 85th percentile of apparent temperature (p {\textless} 0.05). In spite of the urban heat island effect, our measure of urbanization was not associated with higher rates of heat-related mortality. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Based on surface temperature maps retrieved on 15 summer days since 1984, the average surface temperature of each district and neighbourhood within the city was compared to the rural surface temperature outside the city, defined as the SHI intensity. The results showed that the daytime SHI intensity of Rotterdam can be as large as 10°C. Differences in the SHI between the neighbourhoods can be explained by urban surface characteristics. A statistical analysis shows that the SHI is largest for neighbourhoods with scarce vegetation that have a high fraction of impervious surface, and a low albedo. Furthermore, NOAA-AVHHR satellite images were used to monitor the heat wave of July 2006 and retrieve the diurnal variation in the SHI of Rotterdam. Average surface temperature differences between the warmest and coolest districts are maximum 12°C during day, and 9°C during night. Districts with a large night-time SHI differ from districts with a large daytime SHI. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In urban regions, these future heat waves will be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, and will have the potential to negatively influence the health and welfare of urban residents. In order to investigate the health effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in Shanghai, China, 30 years of meteorological records (1975-2004) were examined for 11 first- and second-order weather stations in and around Shanghai. Additionally, automatic weather observation data recorded in recent years as well as daily all-cause summer mortality counts in 11 urban, suburban, and exurban regions (1998-2004) in Shanghai have been used. The results show that different sites (city center or surroundings) have experienced different degrees of warming as a result of increasing urbanization. In turn, this has resulted in a more extensive urban heat island effect, causing additional hot days and heat waves in urban regions compared to rural locales. An examination of summer mortality rates in and around Shanghai yields heightened heat-related mortality in urban regions, and we conclude that the UHI is directly responsible, acting to worsen the adverse health effects from exposure to extreme thermal conditions.},

Extensive statistical analysis revealed strong UHI intensities reaching values up to 6.0. °C with a mean intensity of 3.8. °C during nocturnal hours of August. Heat island in the city proved to be a night dominating phenomenon while wind velocity was found to wield great impact on the ventilation and cooling effect of the city. During summer, early in the morning many locations in the city centre remained cooler than the rural environment while a heat island was observed on a monthly basis during winter. In order to determine the variation of the current energy needs due to the UHI effect, the heating degree hours during winter were calculated and were found to be much lower in the city centre than in the rural area (12.6-14.2{\%} reduction).

abstract = {The village of Barrow, Alaska, is the northernmost settlement in the USA and the largest native community in the Arctic. The population has grown from about 300 residents in 1900 to more than 4600 in 2000. In recent decades, a general increase of mean annual and mean winter air temperature has been recorded near the centre of the village, and a concurrent trend of progressively earlier snowmelt in the village has been documented. Satellite observations and data from a nearby climate observatory indicate a corresponding but much weaker snowmelt trend in the surrounding regions of relatively undisturbed tundra. Because the region is underlain by ice-rich permafrost, there is concern that early snowmelt will increase the thickness of the thawed layer in summer and threaten the structural stability of roads, buildings, and pipelines. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a strong urban heat island (UHI) during winter. Data loggers (54) were installed in the ∼150 km2 study area to monitor hourly air and soil temperature, and daily spatial averages were calculated using the six or seven warmest and coldest sites. During winter (December 2001–March 2002), the urban area averaged 2.2 °C warmer than the hinterland. The strength of the UHI increased as the wind velocity decreased, reaching an average value of 3.2 °C under calm ({\textless}2ms−1) conditions and maximum single-day magnitude of 6 °C. UHI magnitude generally increased with decreasing air temperature in winter, reflecting the input of anthropogenic heat to maintain interior building temperatures. On a daily basis, the UHI reached its peak intensity in the late evening and early morning. There was a strong positive relation between monthly UHI magnitude and natural gas production/use. Integrated over the period September–May, there was a 9{\%} reduction in accumulated freezing degree days in the urban area. The evidence suggests that urbanization has contributed to early snowmelt in the village.},

abstract = {A web-based software tool has been developed to assist urban planners and air quality management officials in assessing the potential of urban heat island mitigation strategies to affect the urban climate, air quality, and energy consumption within their cities. The user of the tool can select from over 170 US cities for which to conduct the analysis, and can specify city-wide changes in surface reflectivity and/or vegetative cover. The Mitigation Impact Screening Tool (MIST) then extrapolates results from a suite of simulations for 20 cities to estimate air temperature changes associated with the specified changes in surface characteristics for the selected city. Alternatively the user can simply define a nominal air temperature reduction that they hope to achieve with an unspecified mitigation scenario. These air temperature changes are then input to energy and ozone models to estimate the impact that the mitigation action may have on the selected city. The results presented by MIST include a high degree of uncertainty and are intended only as a first-order estimate that urban planners can use to assess the viability of heat island mitigation strategies for their cities. As appropriate, MIST analyses should be supplemented by more detailed modeling. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract  This paper explores the characteristics of the air (Tair) and land surface temperature (LST) from the city of Bucharest (Romania) during the extreme high temperatures that affected the region in July 2007. The behavior of Bucharest's Urban Heat Island (UHI) is quantitatively described following similar methodological approaches to previous studies. The analysis integrates thermal data supplied by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the NASA satellites and meteorological data provided by the ground-based weather stations. Based on the Tair, one may claim that during extreme high summer temperatures, the UHI preserves its spatial and temporal pattern regarding the differences between the central urban perimeter and the suburban area. The investigation of the LST from July 2007 reveals that the nocturnal changes refer mainly to the magnitude and the limits of the UHI, while the shape is not changed. However, the extreme temperatures induce significant modifications of the features of the diurnal UHI, obliterating and dissipating it in certain spots, enlarging it and creating shifted heat islands in some other spots. The main explanation is the outstanding duration and intensity of the hot mass of air impacting the area. The correlations between the Tair measured at the weather stations in Bucharest and the corresponding LST retrieved significant values both under “normal” conditions and extreme temperature persistence, and offer good premises for robust validation studies. The MODIS products performed like an extremely useful instrument for analyzing the UHI.},

abstract = {It is a well established fact that the urban landscape creates a climate which in¯uences, for example, human comfort, air quality and energy consumption. However, in spite of this knowledge, it has been recognised that climate issues often have low impact on the urban planning process in practice. The reason for this lack of in¯uence is an important question for which answers must be sought among climatologists, planners and the planning process. The main objective with the present study was to investigate if, how and when knowledge about the climate is used in the urban planning process. The research strategy was developed in an interdisciplinary research group involving climatologists and planners. Case studies involving different interview techniques and historical data were carried out by different actors involved in urban planning at the municipality level in three cities in Sweden. The study showed that urban planners were interested in climatic aspects but the use of climatic information was unsystematic and the results con{\textregistered}rmed that climatology has a low impact on the planning process. The low impact is a result of several constraints which could be related to {\textregistered}ve explanatory variables i.e. conceptual and knowledge based, technical, policy, organisational and the market. The discussion part of the paper presents some key conclusions which address these constraints. It is important that urban climatologists meet the planners demand-driven needs by providing them with good arguments, suitable methods and tools. Urban climatologists are also encouraged to improve the awareness of the importance of urban climate not only among planners but also among decision-makers and the public. However, as planning is a political activity which not always is based on or even related to scienti{\textregistered}c knowledge, some of the identi{\textregistered}ed constraints could only be counteracted through improved institutional capacity in the social context of planning.},

abstract = {To help address the built environmental issues of both heat island and stormwater runoff, strategies that make pavements cooler and permeable have been investigated through measurements and modeling of a set of pavement test sections. The investigation included the hydraulic and thermal performance of the pavements. The permeability results showed that permeable interlocking concrete pavers have the highest permeability (or infiltration rate, ∼0.5 cm s−1). The two permeable asphalt pavements showed the lowest permeability, but still had an infiltration rate of ∼0.1 cm s−1, which is adequate to drain rainwater without generating surface runoff during most typical rain events in central California. An increase in albedo can significantly reduce the daytime high surface temperature in summer. Permeable pavements under wet conditions could give lower surface temperatures than impermeable pavements. The cooling effect highly depends on the availability of moisture near the surface layer and the evaporation rate. The peak cooling effect of watering for the test sections was approximately 15–35 ◦C on the pavement surface temperature in the early afternoon during summer in central California. The evaporative cooling effect on the pavement surface temperature at 4:00 pm on the third day (25 h after watering) was still 2–7 ◦C lower compared to that on the second day, without considering the higher air temperature on the third day. A separate and related simulation study performed by UCPRC showed that full depth permeable pavements, if designed properly, can carry both light-duty traffic and certain heavy-duty vehicles while retaining the runoff volume captured from an average California storm event. These preliminarily results indicated the technical feasibility of combined reflective and permeable pavements for addressing the built environment issues related to both heat island mitigation and stormwater runoff management.

The air flow inside and outside the canyon as well as the air and surface temperatures inside the canyon are measured for a period of seven continuous days during the whole day and night period. The air flow characteristics inside the canyon are analyzed. For perpendicular wind speeds, the air flow inside the canyon is characterized by either a circulatory vortex driven by the ambient air flow or a double vortex flow where the upper one is driven by the ambient air flow and the lower one is driven in the opposite direction by the circulation above. When the ambient air blows parallel to the canyon, the measured wind data inside the canyon indicate a flow in the same direction. When the air flows at a certain angle to the canyon axis, the measured data indicate that a spiral vortex is induced along the canyon length. The spatial and temporal variation of the surface and air temperature distribution inside the canyon is analyzed. The heat island intensity in the canyon is estimated based on measurements from a reference station. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

This experimental work adds to the knowledge available on the microclimate of an urban canyon and its impact on human comfort. Air temperature T a , air humidity VP , wind speed v and direction dd were measured continuously. All short-wave and long-wave radiation fluxes from the 3D surroundings were also measured. The degree of comfort was defined in terms of physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). Furthermore, the data gathered within the canyon were compared to data collected by a permanent urban climate station with the aim of furthering the understanding of microclimatic changes due to street geometry. Changes in the meteorological variables T a , v and dd in the canyon in comparison to an unobstructed roof level location were found to be in good agreement with previous studies, i.e., a small increase of T a in the canyon adjacent to irradiated surfaces, and a good correlation of v and dd between canyon and roof levels. The daily dynamics of canyon facet irradiances and their impacts on the heat gained by a pedestrian were strongly dependent on street geometry and orientation. Thermal stress was mostly attributable to solar exposure. Under cloudless summer weather, a standing body was found to absorb, on average, 74{\%} of heat in the form of long-wave irradiance and 26{\%} as short-wave irradiance. Shading the pedestrian as well as the surrounding surfaces is, hence, the first strategy in mitigating heat stress in summer under hot conditions.},

The difference is caused by anthropogenic heating and the following two effects of urban canyon structure: (i) a larger heat capacity due to the walls and (ii) a smaller sky-view factor. Sensitivity experiments show that the anthropogenic heating increases the surface air temperature though the day.

abstract = {Highly reflective roofs can decrease the energy required for building air conditioning, help mitigate the urban heat island effect, and slow global warming. However, these benefits are diminished by soiling and weathering processes that reduce the solar reflectance of most roofing materials. Soiling results from the deposition of atmospheric particulate matter and the growth of microorganisms, each of which absorb sunlight. Weathering of materials occurs with exposure to water, sunlight, and high temperatures. This study developed an accelerated aging method that incorporates features of soiling and weathering. The method sprays a calibrated aqueous soiling mixture of dust minerals, black carbon, humic acid, and salts onto preconditioned coupons of roofing materials, then subjects the soiled coupons to cycles of ultraviolet radiation, heat and water in a commercial weatherometer. Three soiling mixtures were optimized to reproduce the site-specific solar spectral reflectance features of roofing products exposed for 3 years in a hot and humid climate (Miami, Florida); a hot and dry climate (Phoenix, Arizona); and a polluted atmosphere in a temperate climate (Cleveland, Ohio). A fourth mixture was designed to reproduce the three-site average values of solar reflectance and thermal emittance attained after 3 years of natural exposure, which the Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) uses to rate roofing products sold in the US. This accelerated aging method was applied to 25 products-single ply membranes, factory and field applied coatings, tiles, modified bitumen cap sheets, and asphalt shingles-and reproduced in 3 days the CRRC's 3-year aged values of solar reflectance. This accelerated aging method can be used to speed the evaluation and rating of new cool roofing materials. {\textcopyright} Published by Elsevier B.V.},

These trends in mean annual temperatures, however, are not statistically significant. Comparatively greater warming effects have occurred in spring and winter minimum rather than the maximum temperature records. A regional increase in the mean minimum temperature around 1955 is attributed to the urban heat island effect.

abstract = {Progress in urban climatology over the two decades since the first$\backslash$npublication of the International Journal of Climatology is reviewed.$\backslash$nIt is emphasized that urban climatology during this period has benefited$\backslash$nfrom conceptual advances made in microclimatology and boundary-layer$\backslash$nclimatology in general. The role of scale, heterogeneity, dynamic$\backslash$nsource areas for turbulent fluxes and the complexity introduced by$\backslash$nthe roughness sublayer over the tall, rigid roughness elements of$\backslash$ncities is described. The diversity of urban heat islands, depending$\backslash$non the medium sensed and the sensing technique, is explained. The$\backslash$nreview focuses on two areas within urban climatology. First, it assesses$\backslash$nadvances in the study of selected urban climatic processes relating$\backslash$nto urban atmospheric turbulence (including surface roughness) and$\backslash$nexchange processes for energy and water, at scales of consideration$\backslash$nranging from individual facets of the urban environment, through$\backslash$nstreets and city blocks to neighbourhoods. Second, it explores the$\backslash$nliterature on the urban temperature field. The state of knowledge$\backslash$nabout urban heat islands around 1980 is described and work since$\backslash$nthen is assessed in terms of similarities to and contrasts with that$\backslash$nsituation. Finally, the main advances are summarized and recommendations$\backslash$nfor urban climate work in the future are made.

abstract = {Drawing on evidence from the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe, this paper explores how people have responded to flood warning information and how these responses impact upon the effectiveness of a flood warning through saving lives and injuries, and reducing economic damages. Methods of flood warning that the public rely upon are discussed alongside empirical evidence of how flood victims prepare for, and respond to, flood warnings in rapid to medium-onset floods. The paper investigates why some members of the public fail to act appropriately, or most effectively, to flood warning information, touching on ideas of a lack of understanding, mistrust in authority and a lack of ownership of flood reducing actions. The paper examines the styles of public learning about flood warning response which might be most appropriate and effective, and how recent positive steps to increase the public's understanding of effective response might be further enhanced in the United Kingdom.},

abstract = {[1] Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects adversely impact weather, air quality, and climate. Previous studies have attributed UHI effects to localized, surface processes. Based on an observational and modeling study of an extreme UHI (heat wave) episode in the Baltimore metropolitan region, we find that upstream urbanization exacerbates UHI effects and that meteorological consequences of extra-urban development can cascade well downwind. Under southwesterly wind, Baltimore, MD, experienced higher peak surface temperatures and higher pollution concentrations than did the larger urban area of Washington, DC. Ultra-high resolution numerical simulations with National Land Cover Data (NLCD) of 2001 show a nonlocal, dynamical contribution to UHI effects; when the upstream urban area is replaced by natural vegetation (in the model) the UHI effects could be reduced by more than 25{\%}. These findings suggest that judicious land-use and urban planning, especially in rapidly developing countries, could help alleviate UHI consequences including heat stress and smog.},

Seasonality is evident in aerosol optical thickness measurements, with a minimum in January and a maximum in April to July. The diurnal variations of aerosols, however, are detectable but largely affected by local and regional weather conditions, such as surface and upper-level winds. On calm clear days, aerosols peak during the two rush hours in the morning and evening. Furthermore, the anthropogenic-induced weekly cycles of aerosols and clouds are analyzed, which by themselves are weak, as the anthropogenic signal is mixed with noise of natural weather variability. In addition, corresponding cloud properties observed from MODIS demonstrate an opposite phase to the seasonality of aerosols. Nevertheless, no clear relationship was observed between monthly mean aerosols and rainfall measurements from NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), implying that in the summer the aerosol impact may not be the primary reason for the change of urban rainfall amount.},

Ambient air quality measurements for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, total suspended particles, and dust level were obtained for Guangzhou City in South China between 1981 and 2000. Landsat TM images and aerial photo derived maps were used to examine city's land use and land cover at different times and changes. Landsat thermal infrared data were employed to compute land surface temperatures and to assess urban thermal patterns. Relationships among the spatial patterns of air pollution, land use, and thermal landscape were sought through GIS and correlation analyses. Results show that the spatial patterns of air pollutants probed were positively correlated with urban built-up density, and with satellite derived land surface temperature values, particularly with measurements taken during the summer. It is suggested that further studies investigate the mechanisms of this linkage, and that remote sensing of air pollution delves into how the energy interacts with the atmosphere and the environment and how sensors see pollutants. Thermal infrared imagery could play a unique role in monitoring and modeling atmospheric pollution.},

This feature has been attributed, in part, to reduced urban dew, but links are largely unproven, because urban dew data are rare. In this study, surface moisture (i.e., dew + guttation by blotting) and dewfall (by mini-lysimeter) were measured at rural and urban residential sites in Vancouver, Canada, during the summer of 1996. Air temperature and humidity were measured at both sites, and on rural-to-urban vehicle traverses. Weather and location effects were evident. Humidity data suggested the small ({\textless}1 g m)3) urban moisture excess observed on fine nights was linked to reduced urban dew. For grass, the frequency of moisture events, and surface moisture amounts, were similar for both sites. However, on grass, rural dewfall (mean=0.10 mm per night) was more than urban dewfall (mean=0.07 mm per night). On the other hand, data for a `roof ' lysimeter (mean dewfall=0.12 mm per night) showed that an urban roof could rival rural grass as a favoured location for dewfall in Vancouver.},

abstract = {This study presents the projected urban climate for the 2070s' August in the three largest urban areas, Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya in Japan. To accurately evaluate the urban climate, the simulations use the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model with 3-km grid increment coupled to an urban canopy model (UCM). To project future urban climate, the simulations apply dynamical downscaling to three GCMs (MIROC3.2-medres, MRI-CGCM2.3.2a, CSIRO-Mk3.0) and use the ensemble average for results. The results provide estimates of the heat stress to future residents of Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. The WRF-UCM model reproduces the observed spatial distribution of the surface air temperature in the 2000s' August, giving an all-domain mean bias of -1.2 degrees C and RSME of 2.7 degrees C. For Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, these biases are -0.6, -0.1, and 0.4 degrees C. Moreover, the diurnal temperature variations at these urban stations are well reproduced. The projected monthly average August temperatures in the 2070s are about 2.3 degrees C higher than those in the 2000s at the three urban areas and comparable to those in the record-breaking hot summer of 2010. (Predictions by individual ensemble members differ by 0.8-1.2 degrees C.) As a result, urban areas will experience uncomfortable sleeping nights nearly every day in August, with roughly as many heat-induced sleeping-discomfort nights as those in 2010. Moreover, application of the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) shows that people in Tokyo will be warned not to strenuously exercise outdoors for 62{\%} of the daytime hours in the 2070s, a sharp increase from the 30{\%} of the 2000s. (Predictions by individual ensemble members range from 54-67{\%}). Osaka and Nagoya will have even more restrictions on outdoor exercise. Finally, the urban heat island intensity is 1.5 degrees C in Tokyo of the 2070s, comparable to the background climate warming of 2.3 degrees C.},

abstract = {Since their introduction 40 years ago, worldwide interest in urban climatic map (UCMap) studies has grown. Today, there are over 15 countries around the world processing their own climatic maps, developing urban climatic guidelines, and implementing mitigation measures for local planning practices. Facing the global issue of climate change, it is also necessary to include the changing climatic considerations holistically and strategically in the planning process, and to update city plans. This paper reviews progress in UCMap studies. The latest concepts, key methodologies, selected parameters, map structure, and the procedures of making UCMaps are described in the paper. The mitigation measures inspired by these studies and the associated urban climatic planning recommendations are also examined. More than 30 relevant studies around the world have been cited, and both significant developments and existing problems are discussed. The thermal environment and air ventilation condition within the urban canopy layer (UCL) of the city are important in the analytical processes of the climatic-environmental evaluation. Possible mitigation measures and planned actions include decreasing anthropogenic heat release, improving air ventilation at the pedestrian level, providing more shaded areas, increasing greenery, creating air paths, and controlling building morphologies. Further developments have and will continue to focus on the spatial analysis of human thermal comfort in urban outdoor environments and on the impacts and adaptations of climate change. Mapmakers must continue to share lessons and experiences with city planners and policy makers, especially in the rapidly expanding cities of developing countries and regions.

Nevertheless, Reykjavik shows a weak heat island effect, which converts to a 'cold island' by day in mid summer. The anthropogenic heat release amounts to ca. 35Wm-2. The study also indicates that the bioclimate and human comfort in Reykjavik is determined more by a high wind discomfort than by severe winter temperatures or high air pollution typical for high-latitude cities.

abstract = {This research investigates the effect of urban design factors on summertime urban heat island (UHI) intensity. Ten high-rise residential quarters in the inner city of Shanghai were empirically investigated during mid July to mid August in 2008. On-site design variables were developed to quantify the thermal impacts from density, building layout and greenery. The design variables that were measured on site were correlated with the variation in UHI intensity during the day and night. The results show that variations in UHI are in part due to site planning, building design, and greenery. The overall daytime and nighttime UHI models explain up to 77 and 90 percent of UHI variation, respectively. On-site shading from either buildings or vegetation canopy is the most important factor influencing daytime UHI. The shading factor can distort and dilute behavior of other variables, e.g., green ratio and surface albedo. Nighttime UHI is more complicated due to the influence from anthropogenic heat, and is significantly related to greenery density and coverage. Based on the findings, potential design strategies are proposed in an effort to mitigate UHI, including manipulating building layout and mass to improve shading during the day while facilitating site ventilation at night and increasing site vegetation cover through strategic tree planting. Further recommendations for urban planning approaches to mitigate UHI on the urban scale are proposed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Flow and pollutant dispersion in a densely built-up area of Seoul, Korea, are numerically examined using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled to a mesoscale model [fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5)]. The CFD model used is a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations model with the renormalization group k - e turbulence model. A one-way nesting method is employed in this study. MM5-simulated data are linearly interpolated in time and space to provide time-dependent boundary conditions for the CFD model integration. In the MM5 simulation, four one-way nested computational domains are considered, and the innermost domain with a horizontal grid size of 1 km covers the Seoul metropolitan area and its adjacent areas, including a part of the Yellow Sea. The NCEP final analysis data are used as initial and boundary conditions for MM5. MM5 is integrated for 48 h starting from 0300 LST 1 June 2004 and the coupled CFD-MM5 model is integrated for 24 h starting from 0300 LST 2 June 2004. During the two-day period, a high-pressure system was dominant over the Korean peninsula, with clear conditions and weak synoptic winds. MM5 simulates local circulations characterized by sea breezes and mountain/valley winds. MM5-simulated synoptic weather and near-surface temperatures and winds are well matched with the observed ones. Results from the coupled CFD-MM5 model simulation show that the flow in the presence of real building clusters can change significantly as the ambient wind speed and direction change. Diurnally varying local circulations mainly cause changes in ambient wind speed and direction in the present simulation. Some characteristic flows-such as the double-eddy circulation, channeling flow, and vertical recirculation vortex-are simulated. Pollutant dispersion pattern and the degree of lateral pollutant dispersion are shown to be complicated in the presence of real building clusters and under varying ambient wind speed and direction. This study suggests that because of the sensitive dependency of urban flow and pollutant dispersion on variations in ambient wind, time-dependent boundary conditions should be used to better simulate or predict them when the ambient wind varies over the period of CFD model simulation.},

In a second set of simulations, we ran ENVI-met for nine combined tree planting and landscaping scenarios (mesic, oasis, and xeric) with regular roofs and cool roofs under current climate conditions and two climate change projections. For each of the 54 scenarios, we compared average neighborhood mid-afternoon air temperatures and assessed the benefits of each heat mitigation measure under current and projected climate conditions. Findings suggest that the relationship between percent canopy cover and air temperature reduction is linear, with 0.14. °C cooling per percent increase in tree cover for the neighborhood under investigation. An increase in tree canopy cover from the current 10{\%} to a targeted 25{\%} resulted in an average daytime cooling benefit of up to 2.0. °C in residential neighborhoods at the local scale. Cool roofs reduced neighborhood air temperatures by 0.3. °C when implemented on residential homes. The results from this city-specific mitigation project will inform messaging campaigns aimed at engaging the city decision makers, industry, and the public in the green building and urban forestry initiatives.},

abstract = {'Urban greening' has been proposed as one approach to mitigate the human health consequences of increased temperatures resulting from climate change. We used systematic review methodology to evaluate available evidence on whether greening interventions, such as tree planting or the creation of parks or green roofs, affect the air temperature of an urban area. Most studies investigated the air temperature within parks and beneath trees and are broadly supportive that green sites can be cooler than non-green sites. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data on the cooling effect of parks and results show that, on average, a park was 0.94 °C cooler in the day. Studies on multiple parks suggest that larger parks and those with trees could be cooler during the day. However, evidence for the cooling effect of green space is mostly based on observational studies of small numbers of green sites. The impact of specific greening interventions on the wider urban area, and whether the effects are due to greening alone, has yet to be demonstrated. The current evidence base does not allow specific recommendations to be made on how best to incorporate greening into an urban area. Further empirical research is necessary in order to efficiently guide the design and planning of urban green space, and specifically to investigate the importance of the abundance, distribution and type of greening. Any urban greening programme implemented would need to be appropriately designed and monitored to continue to evaluate benefit to human health through reducing temperature. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) has become a growing concern to the quality of densely built urban environments, particularly in tropical cities. Wind speed has widely been reported to have decreased the intensity of heat island effect in urban areas. The cooling effect of the wind helps to mitigate the adverse effects of heat island on the micro climate and human thermal comfort. This paper investigates the existence of heat island in Muar, one of the fast growing cities in southern part of Malaysia and its possible causes, and then examines the effects of different urban geometry on the wind flow. The results of this study indicate that the chaotic development in Muar has caused reduced ventilation in urban canyons. The heat island intensity in the city center was recorded as 4. °C during the day and 3.2. °C during the night. Investigation of various urban geometry modifications showed that step up configuration was the most effective geometry as it can distribute the wind evenly allowing the wind to reach even the leeward side of each building. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents results characterising the urban heat island intensity (UHI) in London during the peak winter season. Most UHI studies focus on the phenomenon during the summer as this is the period when temperature peaks are observed. However, for urban planning mitigation strategies and building energy demand design, the heating season should be also considered, since proposed measures to alleviate the summer UHI might have a negative effect during the winter or intermediate seasons. The study carries out trend and regression analysis by controlling climatic and geographical variations in the data set following a methodology developed for studying summer UHI [Kolokotroni, M., Giridharan, R., 2008. Urban heat island intensity in London: an investigation of the impact of physical characteristics on changes in outdoor air temperature during summer. Solar Energy 82, 986-998]. It was found that average nocturnal UHI of winter periods are of similar magnitude to the summer periods but the peak winter UHI trends are not as regular as summer giving a first indication that the effect of climate and urban parameters is different. The regression analysis in this research uses six on-site variables namely aspect ratio, surface albedo, plan density ratio, green density ratio, fabric density ratio and thermal mass to carry out impact investigation in six data sets, categorised by three geographical location within London and three sky conditions and regional wind velocity. The above variables do not explain the changes in outdoor temperature as much as they did during summer period models. However, unlike summer, the winter climate control models have the same R2indicating that most of changes in outdoor temperature are caused by climate factors and not the on-site variables. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Nichol2009a,
abstract = {This study demonstrates that thermal satellite images combined with 'in situ' ground data can be used to examine models of heat island genesis and thus identify the main causes of urban heat islands (UHIs). The models, although proposed over 30 years ago, have not been thoroughly evaluated due to a combination of inadequate ground data and the low resolution of thermal satellite data. Also there has been limited understanding of the relevance of satellite-derived surface temperatures to local and regional scale air temperatures. A cloud-free ASTER thermal image of urban and rural areas of Hong Kong was obtained on a winter night with a well-developed heat island, accompanied by a 148 km vehicle traverse of air temperatures. Over the whole traverse a high R2of 0.80 was observed between surface and air temperatures, with the two datasets showing a similar amplitude and general trend, but with the surface exhibiting much higher local variability than air temperature. Gradients in both surface and air temperature could be related to differences in land cover, with little evidence of large scale advection, thus supporting the population/physical structure model of UHI causation, rather than the advection model. However, the much higher surface and air temperatures observed over the largest urban area, Kowloon, than over any smaller urban centre with similar physical structure in the New Territories, would seem more indicative of the advection model. The image and ground data suggest that Kowloon's urban canopy layer climate is mainly influenced by local city structure, but it is also modified by a strongly developed, regional scale urban boundary layer which has developed over the largest urban centre of Kowloon, and reinforces heating from both above and below. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

Rural cooling followed Brunt's formula, but the urban area showed a linear drop in temperature with time. Hence it was possible to assign a rural thermal admittance, but not an urban one.

abstract = {The impact of the urban heat island (UHI) effect on environmental and regional climate has been receiving wide attention in recent decades. Taiwan, especially Taipei (located in northern Taiwan), is experiencing a significant UHI effect due to its high population density and the uniqueness of the geographic structure. In order to evaluate the impacts of urbanization and UHI effect over northern Taiwan, a next generation mesoscale model, Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Noah land surface model and Urban Canopy model (UCM), was used to study this issue. By using the WRF-Noah-UCM model, it has significantly improved our simulation results for the prediction of the UHI effect, boundary layer development, and land sea breeze. Observations of weather stations and Lidar showed that the near surface air temperature was nearly 34-35 °C and the boundary layer height was nearly 1500 m around noon in Taipei on 17 June 2006. Around midnight, the air temperature ranged from 26 to 28 °C. Our model can predict well for boundary layer development during the daytime and the UHI effect in northern Taiwan. Sensitivity tests indicate that the anthropogenic heat (AH) plays an important role for the boundary layer development and UHI intensity in the Taipei area, especially during nighttime and early morning. When we increase AH by 100 W m-2in the model, the average surface temperature could increase nearly 0.3 °C in Taipei. Furthermore, we found the UHI effect also has a significant impact on land sea circulation. It could enhance the sea breeze in the daytime and weaken the land breeze during the nighttime and hence had a significant impact on the air pollution diffusion in northern Taiwan. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Based on China's fifth population survey (2000) data and homogenized annual mean surface air temperature data, the urban heat island (UHI) effect on the warming during the last 50 years in China was analyzed in this study. In most cities with population over 104, where there are national reference stations and principal stations, most of the temperature series are inevitably affected by the UHI effect. To detect the UHI effect, the annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) time series were firstly classified into 5 subregions by using Rotated Principal Components Analysis (RPCA) according to its high and low frequency climatic change features. Then the average UHI effect on each subregion's regional annual mean STA was studied. Results indicate that the UHI effect on the annual mean temperatures includes three aspects: increase of the average values, decrease of variances and change of the climatic trends. The effect on the climatic trends is different from region to region. In the Yangtze River Valley and South China, the UHI effect enhances the warming trends by about 0.011 °C/decade. In the other areas, such as Northeast, North-China, and Northwest, UHI has little impact on the warming trends of the regional annual temperature; while in the Southwest of China, introducing UHI stations slows down the warming trend by −0.006 °C/decade. But no matter what subregion it is, the total warming/cooling of these effects is much smaller than the background change in regional temperature. The average UHI effect for the entire country, during the last 50 years is less than 0.06 °C, which agrees well with the IPCC (2001). This suggests that we cannot conclude that urbanization during the last 50 years has had much obvious effect on the observed warming in China.},

Recent studies of this phenomenon have suggested that this may not be important to estimates of regional climate change once data are properly corrected. However, surface air temperatures within urban environments have significant variation, making correction difficult. In the current study, we examine subsurface temperatures in an urban environment and the surrounding rural area to help characterize the nature of this variability. The results of our study indicate that subsurface temperatures are linked to land-use and supports previous work indicating that the urban heat island effect has significant and complex spatial variability. In most situations, the relationship between subsurface and surface processes cannot be easily determined, indicating that previous studies that relying on such a linkage may require further examination.},

@article{Hafner1999,
abstract = {Although it has been studied for over 160 years, the urban heat island (UHI) effect is still not completely understood, yet it is increasingly important. The main purpose of this work is to improve UHI modeling by using AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) satellite data to retrieve the surface parameters (albedo, as well as soil thermal and moisture properties). In this study, a hydrostatic three-dimensional mesoscale model was used to perform the numerical modeling. The Carlson technique was applied to retrieve the thermal inertia and moisture availability using the thermal AVHRR channels 4 and 5. The net urban effect was determined as the difference between urban and nonurban simulations, in which urban parameters were replaced by rural parameters. Two winter days were each used for two numerical simulations: a control and an urban-to-rural replacement run. Moisture availability values on the less windy day showed generally a south to north gradient downwind of the city and urban values less than rural values (the urban dry island day). Moisture availability was higher on the windy day, with uniform values in the rural and urban areas (uniform soil moisture day). The only exceptions were variations in the rural hills north of the city and the low rural values under the polluted urban plume downwind of the city. While thermal inertia values showed no urban–rural differences on the uniformsoil moisture day, they exhibited larger values over Atlanta than in surrounding rural area on the (less moist) dry island day. Two puzzling facts exist in the data: 1) lack of a north–south thermal inertia gradient on the dry soil day to correspond to its above- mentioned moisture availability gradient and 2) rural thermal inertia values do not change between both days in spite of their large difference in soil moisture. The observed lack of corresponding urban change is expected, as its thermal inertia values depend more on urban building materials than on moisture of soil. In both cases both the 2-m and surface skin UHIs showed positive values at night and negative values (an urban cool island, UCI) during the day. The larger nighttime 2-m UHI was on the dry day (0.8 vs 0.6C), while the larger daytime 2-m UCI was on the moist soil day (0.3 vs 0.5C). Note that the surface differences were almost always greater than the 2-m differences. These day–night differences imply a rural thermal inertia lower than its urban values on both days, which is in conflict with the observations on the wet uniform soil moisture day. On the uniform thermal inertia day (wet day), both the UHI and UCI amplitudes should be less than on the other day, but this is not the case. A possible explanation for both of these conflicts is the improper influence of the urban plume on this day on lowering the thermal inertia and moisture availability values used in the replacement urban simulation.},

abstract = {Using a micro-scale urban simulation program, we examined the sensitivity of air temperature and mean radiant temperature (MRT) of built-up urban cores to urban-area geometry (the density of buildings), thermal properties of human-made surfaces (albedo) and green cover (street trees), in 2 warm-climate cities: Pettah, Colombo (Sri Lanka) and downtown Phoenix, Arizona (USA). Air temperature and MRT are indicative of human thermal comfort, and their rural/urban gradients signify the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Although high albedo values lead to low daytime temperatures in both cities, the best thermal comfort, quantified by both the air temperature and MRT, was found in high-density development. Thus, density enhancement is a viable UHI mitigation option in built-up areas of warm climate cities. Manipulation of thermal properties is an alternative strategy, but the practical utility of high albedo surfaces is questionable. Additionally, some UHI mitigation options are more likely to bring improvements in MRT than in air temperature. Urban designers should use mitigation options that are based on human comfort, which is determined by both MRT and air temperature, rather than simply attempting to control air temperature alone.},

abstract = {Weather and climate changes caused by human activities (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and urbanization) have received much attention because of their impacts on human lives as well as scientific interests. The detection, understanding, and future projection of weather and climate changes due to urbanization are important subjects in the discipline of urban meteorology and climatology. This article reviews urban impacts on precipitation. Observational studies of changes in convective phenomena over and around cities are reviewed, with focus on precipitation enhancement downwind of cities. The proposed causative factors (urban heat island, large surface roughness, and higher aerosol concentration) and mechanisms of urban-induced and/or urban-modified precipitation are then reviewed and discussed, with focus on downwind precipitation enhancement. A universal mechanism of urban-induced precipitation is made through a thorough literature review and is as follows. The urban heat island produces updrafts on the leeward or downwind side of cities, and the urban heat island-induced updrafts initiate moist convection under favorable thermodynamic conditions, thus leading to surface precipitation. Surface precipitation is likely to further increase under higher aerosol concentrations if the air humidity is high and deep and strong convection occurs. It is not likely that larger urban surface roughness plays a major role in urbaninduced precipitation. Larger urban surface roughness can, however, disrupt or bifurcate precipitating convective systems formed outside cities while passing over the cities. Such urban-modified precipitating systems can either increase or decrease precipitation over and/or downwind of cities. Much effort is needed for in-depth or new understanding of urban precipitation anomalies, which includes local and regional modeling studies using advanced numerical models and analysis studies of long-term radar data. {\textcopyright} The Korean Meteorological Society and Springer 2014.},

abstract = {This paper, while referring to a case study, focuses on the assessment of the input parameters based on the equations solved by ENVI-met. The output data of different micrometeorological variables and Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) were compared to the experimental values measured on the field in different points and for several days. The results provided by the software were examined while taking into consideration a different cell size of the mesh as well. However significant differences were not recognized and the 2 × 2 m2cell-sized model was chosen; it represents a good compromise for what concerns results' accuracy and computation time. This gave the possibility to determine a deviation of 0.6{\%} for air temperature, 0.9{\%} for mean radiant temperature, about 2.0{\%} for relative humidity and about 10{\%} for global radiation. The predictive ability of the software was also testified, for air temperature and mean radiant temperature, by the analysis of the coefficient of determination, Root Mean Square Error and Willmott's index of agreement. Then the PMV values were compared with those measured during a field survey with an average deviation of 0.76 units and it was possible to determine how, among the different Lateral Boundary Conditions (LBC), the open type leads to more reliable results. Finally the latest version of the software was tested and in the conclusions a general procedure to perform simulations in ENVI-met is suggested.},

abstract = {The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, located in the southern part of Guangdong Province in China, is one of the most rapidly developing regions in the world. The evolution of local and regional sea-breeze circulation (SBC) is believed to be responsible for forming meteorological conditions for high air-pollution episodes in the PRD. To understand better the impacts of urbanization and its associated urban heat island (UHI) on the local- and regional-scale atmospheric circulations over PRD, a number of high-resolution numerical experiments, with different approaches to treat the land surface and urban processes, have been conducted using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5). The results show that an accurate urban land-use dataset and a proper urban land-use parameterization are critical for the mesoscale model to capture the major features of the observed UHI effect and land-sea-breeze circulations in the PRD. Stronger UHI in the PRD increases the differential temperature gradient between urbanized areas and nearby ocean surface and hence enhances the mesoscale SBC. The SBC front consequently penetrates farther inland to overcome the prevailing easterly flow in the western part of inland Hong Kong. Additional sensitivity studies indicate that further industrial development and urbanization will strengthen the daytime SBC as well as increase the air temperature in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere.},

The seasonal and monthly air temperature difference between a street canyon and a nearby open area, as well as case studies of the vertical and horizontal temperature distribution within and between different urban units and urban districts are discussed. In spite of a good relationship between the local surface temperature and the sky view-factor, both continuous measurements and case studies show small variations in air temperature within the city centre. Air temperature variations between urban districts of different land use are greater. The average horizontal temperature decrease of 4°C in the transition zone from the city centre to a large park southwest of the centre are, in fact, of the same order as the average urban-rural air temperature difference.},

abstract = {New developments of the international community in modeling the urban canopy surface energy balance are presented and classified into five main categories: (i) models statistically fit to observations, (ii) and (iii) modified vegetation schemes with or without drag terms in the canopy, and (iv) and (v), new urban canopy schemes, that present both horizontal and vertical surfaces, again with or without a drag approach. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of model are explained. In general, the more the physics are correctly simulated, the more complex are the urban phenomenon that can be addressed, on the other hand however, the more consuming of computer-time and difficult to couple with atmospheric models the scheme becomes. Present use of these new models in meso-scale atmospheric models show their ability to reproduce the phenomenon of the urban heat island (UHI) and some of its consequences urban breezes, storm initiation, interaction with sea-breeze. Their use opens up new perspectives, for example in the mitigation of the UHI, or assessment of the role of air-conditioning systems or the impact of urban dynamics on air pollution. However, there is need to validate further the different urban models available. In particular it is necessary to compare model output with urban surface energy balance measurements. An intercomparison exercise involving these urban schemes is suggested as an efficient way to assess and improve these models.},

abstract = {Hong Kong suffers from an intense urban heat island (UHI) effect of up to 4 °C as a result of compact urban form and highly urbanized land cover. Enhancing the cooling efficiency of urban greenery is essential for improving the microclimate in high-density cities. This paper aims to delineate design strategies for urban greenery to maximize thermal benefits and mitigate the daytime UHI effect. Two site-specific design strategies for tree planting in the urban environment are proposed. The sky view factor (SVF)-based design approach and the wind-path design approach are evaluated in the neighbourhood scale in two climate-sensitive areas with different urban morphologies. Observed data and simulation results indicated that the cooling effect of urban trees is highly associated with SVF. Air temperature reduction (a 1.5 °C reduction) is the most profound for the high SVF scenario, whereas substantial radiation shading (Tmrtreduced to 34 °C) is detected in areas with medium-low SVFs. The modelling study also showed that the cooling of air temperature and sensible heat were twice as high for vegetation arranged in wind corridors than those for leeward areas. The study demonstrated that tree planting in conjunction with proper planning is an effective measure to mitigate daytime UHI.},

abstract = {Cities profoundly alter biological communities, favoring some species over others, though the mechanisms that govern these changes are largely unknown. Herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant in urban than in rural areas, and urban outbreaks have been attributed to reduced control by predators and parasitoids and to increased susceptibility of stressed urban plants. These hypotheses, however, leave many outbreaks unexplained and fail to predict variation in pest abundance within cities. Here we show that the abundance of a common insect pest is positively related to temperature even when controlling for other habitat characteristics. The scale insect Parthenolecanium quercifex was 13 times more abundant on willow oak trees in the hottest parts of Raleigh, NC, in the southeastern United States, than in cooler areas, though parasitism rates were similar. We further separated the effects of heat from those of natural enemies and plant quality in a greenhouse reciprocal transplant experiment. P. quercifex collected from hot urban trees became more abundant in hot greenhouses than in cool greenhouses, whereas the abundance of P. quercifex collected from cooler urban trees remained low in hot and cool greenhouses. Parthenolecanium quercifex living in urban hot spots succeed with warming, and they do so because some demes have either acclimatized or adapted to high temperatures. Our results provide the first evidence that heat can be a key driver of insect pest outbreaks on urban trees. Since urban warming is similar in magnitude to global warming predicted in the next 50 years, pest abundance on city trees may foreshadow widespread outbreaks as natural forests also grow warmer.},

abstract = {This article briefly reviews urban warming studies in Japan, where many of the stations established by the beginning of the 20th century are located in cities that have undergone rapid industrialization. The recorded rate of temperature increase is a few degrees per century in large cities and tends to be larger at night than during the daytime. In some cities, the increase in annual extreme minimum temperature exceeds 10 °C century−1. On the other hand, recent numerical studies have revealed widespread urban warming around Tokyo and other megacities during afternoons of the warm season as a result of extensive urbanization that enhances daytime surface heating. An analysis using data from the dense Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System network has shown that an urban bias in recent temperature trends is detectable not only in densely inhabited areas but also at slightly urbanized sites with 100–300 people km−2, indicating the need for careful assessment of the background climate change. There is also some evidence of microscale effects on observed temperature, as revealed by an analysis of the relationship between trends in temperature and wind speed.

abstract = {Data for a 4-year period from G{\"{o}}teborg, Sweden was used to investigate the urban–rural humidity differences during clear and calm nights. The purpose was to analyse the impact of the Urban Moisture Excess (UME) on the Urban Heat Island (UHI) with focus on the longwave radiation balance and the latent heat flux. The statistical analysis demonstrated that a hot summer with reduced precipitation increased the mean UME to 3 hPa (‘normal' summer conditions demonstrated an UME of about 1 hPa) and during some nights the UME was as high as 7 hPa. The analysis also demonstrated a positive correlation between UME and UHI, with the maximum UHI preceding the maximum UME by between 2 and 5 h. An analysis of the nocturnal development of UME demonstrated that the UME could develop from three combinations of urban and rural vapour pressure changes. The initial level of the rural vapour pressure, and thus the conditions for dewfall proved to be important. The influence of an UME of 3 hPa on the downward longwave radiation was calculated to about 3 W m−2, which is 12{\%} of the urban–rural radiation difference giving a weak enhancing effect of the UME on the UHI. Advection of dry air from the UHI circulation was considered to influence the urban vapour pressure change. After correction of the advective effect on the urban vapour pressure change, the urban–rural difference in the latent heat flux ranged from −5 to −25 W m−2, which demonstrates that UME also has a considerable negative feedback on the UHI development.

Such countermeasures include reduction of anthropogenic heat release and enhancement of urban ventilation. Evaluations of urban ventilation require construction of a high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, which takes into account complex urban morphology. The morphological complexity arises from multi-scale geometry consisting of buildings, forests, and rivers, which is superimposed on varying topography. Given this background, airflow and temperature fields over the 23 wards of Tokyo were simulated with a CFD technique using a total of approximately 5 billion computational grid cells with a horizontal grid spacing of 5 m. The root mean square (RMS) error of the air temperature between the simulation and observation results at 127 points was 1.1 degrees C. Using the developed model, an urban redevelopment plan for two districts in metropolitan Tokyo was examined from the viewpoint of air temperature mitigation. Numerical results showed that a reduction by 1 ha in the area covered by buildings increases the area with temperatures below 30 degrees C by 12 ha. Copyright. (C) 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

This work combines experimental and observational methodology to provide a better and deeper view of climatic habitat in an urban context with a view to understanding the relationship between plant development and urban climate on the intra-urban scale (by taking into account town structure). A dense network of 17 meteorological stations was set up in Rennes, France, enabling us to identify and quantify climatic changes associated with the UHI. Meanwhile, phenological observations were made during early spring (March and April) in 2005 on Platanus acerifolia and Prunus cerasus to study the relationship between climatic and phenological data. The results show that there is both a climatic gradient and a developmental gradient corresponding to the type of urbanisation in the town of Rennes. The town influences plant phenology by reducing the diurnal temperature range and by increasing the minimum temperature as one approaches the town centre. The influence of ground cover type (plants or buildings) on development is also shown. The developmental phases of preflowering and flowering are influenced to differing extents by climatic variables. The period during which climatic variables are effective before a given developmental phase varies considerably. The preflowering phases are best correlated with the mean of the minimum air temperature for the 15-day period before the observation, whereas flowering appears to be more dependent on the mean of the daily diurnal temperature range for the 8 days preceding the observation.},

Results show that the urbanization can induce a remarkable summer warming in Yangtze River Delta (YRD) city cluster region and a winter warming in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) city cluster region. The YRD warming in summer primarily results from the significant increasing of maximum temperature, with an estimated urban warming rate at 0.132-0.250 degrees C per decade, accounting for 36{\%}-68{\%} of the total regional warming. The BTH warming in winter is primarily due to the remarkable increasing of minimum temperature, with an estimated urban warming rate at 0.102-0.214 degrees C per decade, accounting for 12{\%}-24{\%} of the total regional warming. The temporal-spatial differences of urban warming effect may be attributed to the variation of regional climatic background and the change of anthropogenic heat release.},

At Sky Harbor Airport, urbanization has increased the nighttime minimum temperature by 5 • C and the average daily temperatures by 3.1 • C. Urban warming has increased the number of " misery hours per day " for humans, which may have important social consequences. Other impacts include (1) increased energy consumption for heating and cooling of buildings, (2) increased heat stress (but decreased cold stress) for plants, (3) reduced quality of cotton fiber and reduced dairy production on the urban fringe, and (4) a broadening of the seasonal thermal window for arthropods. Climate feedback loops associated with evapotranspiration, energy production and consumption associated with increased air conditioning demand, and land conversion are discussed. Urban planning and design policy could be redesigned to mitigate urban warming, and several cities in the region are incorporating concerns regarding urban warming into planning codes and practices. The issue is timely and important, because most of the world's human population growth over the next 30 years will occur in cities in warm climates.},

abstract = {[1] Global surface temperature trends, based on land and marine data, show warming of about 0.8°C over the last 100 years. This rate of warming is sometimes questioned because of the existence of well-known Urban Heat Islands (UHIs). We show examples of the UHIs at London and Vienna, where city center sites are warmer than surrounding rural locations. Both of these UHIs however do not contribute to warming trends over the 20th century because the influences of the cities on surface temperatures have not changed over this time. In the main part of the paper, for China, we compare a new homogenized station data set with gridded temperature products and attempt to assess possible urban influences using sea surface temperature (SST) data sets for the area east of the Chinese mainland. We show that all the land-based data sets for China agree exceptionally well and that their residual warming compared to the SST series since 1951 is relatively small compared to the large-scale warming. Urban-related warming over China is shown to be about 0.1°C decade−1 over the period 1951–2004, with true climatic warming accounting for 0.81°C over this period.},

abstract = {The growing interest in urbanization problems is stimulating detailed studies of their effects on local climate change in the developed world. The absence of such studies in developing countries is restricting many decisions to be made and applied by policymakers. In one developing country, Turkey, results of the study of four urban stations and their neighboring rural sites for the 1951-1990 time period reveal that there is a shift towards the warmer side in the frequency distributions of daily minimum and 21.00 hr temperature difference series. This shift is an indication of urban heat island. The maximum urban heat island intensity trend that is obtained from the temperature differences database agrees well with Oke's (1973) formula for European cities. Seasonal analysis of individual 21.00 hr temperature series suggests that the regional warming is strongest in spring and weakest in autumn and winter. Urban warming is detected to be more or less equally distributed over the year with a slight increase in the autumn months. The Mann-Kendall trend test is applied to the temperature difference series, and the urban heat island effect is found to be significant in all urban sites. On the other hand, almost no significant urban effect on precipitation can be detected.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of urban land on the climate in Europe on local and regional scales. Effects of urban land cover on the climate are isolated using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU–NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5) with a modified land surface scheme based on the Town Energy Budget model. Two model scenarios represent responses of climate to different states of urbanization in Europe: 1) no urban areas and 2) urban land in the actual state in the beginning of the twenty-first century. By comparing the simulations of these contrasting scenarios, spatial differences in near-surface temperature and precipitation are quantified. Simulated near-surface temperatures and an urban heat island for January and July over a period of 6 yr (2000–05) agree well with corresponding measurements at selected urban areas. The conversion of rural to urban land results in statistically significant changes to precipitation and near-surface temperature over areas of the land cover perturbations. The diurnal temperature range in urbanized regions was reduced on average by 1.26° +- 0.71°C in summer and by 0.73° +- 00.54°C in winter. Inclusion of urban areas results in an increase of urban precipitation in winter (0.09 +- 00.16 mm/day) and a precipitation reduction in summer (-0.05 +- 0.22 mm/day).},

abstract = {Abstract Several equations were developed that related the effect of urban growth, measured by increasing population, to the mean seasonal and annual temperature: the diurnal maximum, minimum, average, and range. These equations were derived from a network of 1219 stations across the United States, which were analyzed for the years 1901–84. The results indicate that urban effects on temperature are detectable even for small towns with populations under 10 000. Stations with populations near 10 000 are shown to average 0.1°C warmer for the mean annual temperature than nearby stations located in rural areas with populations less than 2000. Urbanization decreases the daily maxima in all seasons except winter and the temperature range in all seasons. It increases the diurnal minima and the daily means in all seasons. The equations indicate that, for the annual mean temperature, urbanization during the twentieth century accounts for a warm bias of about 0.06°C in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (HCN). ...},

abstract = {In the context of expansion of cities and raise of climate change awareness, urban planers are looking for methods and tools in order to take into account the urban heat island phenomenon. This study analyzes the way urban fabric modifies urban climate through the utilization of a climate scheme called Local Climate Zone (LCZ). This classification has been applied in Nancy (France). Urban indicators have been calculated so as to build 13 LCZ in the Great Nancy Area. The screen-height air temperature distribution has been investigated inside these LCZ via mobile measurements. Air temperature amplitude has mainly demonstrated lower values at nighttime than in daytime in urbanized LCZ types. Recurrent microscale hotspots and coldspots have been located in LCZ presenting heterogeneous urban fabric. Two Control Sites (CS) have been built in each LCZ. The CS average temperature has revealed good likeness with the spatially averaged air temperature. Average nocturnal air temperature differences between pairs of LCZ types have been obtained. These differences vary from less than 1°°C for close LCZ types to more than 4°°C for dissimilar LCZ types.},

Besides very detailed field measurements of the structure and dynamics of the urban boundary layer, a series of satellite data has been analyzed and validated. Satellite data from MODIS, NOAA-AVHRR (14, 15, and 16) and Landsat-ETM were used and recorded during June and July 2002 in parallel to the BUBBLE field campaign. MODIS and NOAA-AVHRR data represent day and nighttime surface radiation temperatures in 930 m and 1100 m grid size. Landsat-ETM offers a unique resolution on 60 m, but with only daytime imagery at about the same time of MODIS overpass is available. This enables the validation of satellite measurements from different sensors with ground measurements at locations with various degrees of spatial homogeneity/heterogeneity (urban/rural land use). Several different algorithms for NOAA-AVHRR data were compared with in-situ measurements. The results show a very high correlation of the long wave emissions measured by the satellite with the in-situ measurements showing an accuracy of ± 3{\%} to 5{\%} on average, even in urban environments. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to how heat-related health effects vary with the micro-urban variation of outdoor temperatures. This study explored whether people located in micro-urban heat islands are at higher risk of mortality during hot summer days. METHODS: Data used included (1) daily mortality for Montreal (Canada) for June-August 1990-2003, (2) daily mean ambient outdoor temperatures at the local international airport and (3) two thermal surface images (Landsat satellites, infrared wavelengths). A city-wide temperature versus daily mortality function was established on the basis of a case-crossover design; this function was stratified according to the surface temperature at decedents' place of death. RESULTS: The risk of death on warm summer days in areas with higher surface temperatures was greater than in areas with lower surface temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that measures aimed at reducing the temperature in micro-urban heat islands (eg, urban greening activities) may reduce the health impact of hot temperatures. Further studies are needed to document the variation of heat-related risks within cities and to evaluate the health benefits of measures aimed at reducing the temperature in micro-urban heat islands.},

abstract = {We analyse historical (1900 – present) and recent (year 2002) data on New York city's urban heat island (UHI) effect, to characterize changes over time and spatially within the city. The historical annual data show that UHI intensification is responsible for ∼1/3 of the total warming the city has experienced since 1900. The intensification correlates with a significant drop in windspeed over the century, likely due to an increase in the urban boundary layer as Manhattan's extensive skyline development unfolded. For the current-day, using 2002 data, we calculate the hourly and seasonal strength of the city's UHI for five different case study areas, including sites in Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn. We find substantial intra-city variation (∼2 °C) in the strength of the hourly UHI, with some locations showing daytime cool islands – i.e., temperatures lower than the average of the distant non-urban stations, while others, at the same time, show daytime heat islands. The variations are not easily explained in terms of land surface characteristics such as building stock, population, vegetation fraction or radiometric surface temperatures from remote sensing. Although it has been suggested that stations within urban parks will underestimate UHI, the Central Park station does not show a significant underestimate, except marginally during summer nights. The intra-city heat island variations in the residential areas broadly correlate with summertime electricity demand and sensitivity to temperature increases. This relationship will have practical value for energy demand management policy, as it will help prioritize areas for UHI mitigation.},

abstract = {The cooling effect of small urban green wooded sites of various geometric configurations in summer is the object of this study. It was studied experimentally at 11 different wooded sites in the Tel-Aviv urban complex during the period July–August 1996. An empirical model is developed in this study for predicting the cooling effect inside the wooded sites. The model is based on the statistical analysis carried out on 714 experimental observations gathered each hour from the 11 sites on calm days, when urban climate is expressed. Two factors were found to explain over 70{\%} of the air temperature variance inside the studied green site, namely, the partial shaded area under the tree canopy and the air temperature of the non-wooded surroundings adjoining the site. The specific cooling effect of the site due to its geometry and tree characteristics, besides the shading, was found to be relatively small, about 0.5 K, out of an average cooling of about 3 K at noon. The cooling effect of the green wooded areas on their immediate surroundings at noon was also analyzed. The findings corroborate earlier studies that the range is noticeable. At small green sites, the cooling effect estimated in this study is perceivable up to about 100 m in the streets branching out from the site. The empirical findings in this study permit development of tools for incorporating the climatic effects of green areas in the urban design. Some policy measures are proposed accordingly, for alleviating the “heat island” effect in the urban environment.},

abstract = {Green walls provide an option for reducing the thermal load on buildings, reducing the requirement for mechanised air conditioning and helping to mitigate urban heat islands. The range and extent of benefits can vary with green wall typology. This research investigated green fa{\c{c}}ades utilising wall shrubs and climbing plants to reduce air temperature adjacent to, and surface temperatures of, brick walls. Artificial wall sections were used to provide replicated data sets in both outdoor and controlled environmental conditions. During periods of high solar irradiance outdoors, the presence of live Prunus laurocerasus plants placed against walls significantly reduced air and surface temperatures compared to blank walls, but also in comparison to excised (non-transpiring) plant sections. Largest temperature differentials were recorded mid-late afternoon, where air adjacent to vegetated walls was 3°C cooler than non-vegetated walls. Prunus also provided significant wall cooling in controlled environment studies, but was intermediate in its surface cooling capacity (6.3°C) compared to other species; Stachys and Hedera providing {\textgreater}7.0°C cooling. When evaluated on a per leaf area basis, however, other species demonstrated greater cooling potential with Fuchsia, Jasminum and Lonicera out-performing others. Not only was it evident that different species varied in their cooling capacity, but that the mechanisms for providing wall cooling varied between species. Fuchsia promoted evapo-transpiration cooling, whereas shade cooling was more important in Jasminum and Lonicera. Plant physiology and leaf area/morphology should be considered when selecting species to maximise cooling in green wall applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Heatwaves present a significant health risk and the hazard is likely to escalate with the increased future temperatures presently predicted by climate change models. The impact of heatwaves is often felt strongest in towns and cities where populations are concentrated and where the climate is often unintentionally modified to produce an urban heat island effect; where urban areas can be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The purpose of this interdisciplinary study is to integrate remotely sensed urban heat island data alongside commercial social segmentation data via a spatial risk assessment methodology in order to highlight potential heat health risk areas and build the foundations for a climate change risk assessment. This paper uses the city of Birmingham, UK as a case study area. Results: When looking at vulnerable sections of the population, the analysis identifies a concentration of "very high" risk areas within the city centre, and a number of pockets of "high risk" areas scattered throughout the conurbation. Further analysis looks at household level data which yields a complicated picture with a considerable range of vulnerabilities at a neighbourhood scale. Conclusions: The results illustrate that a concentration of "very high" risk people live within the urban heat island, and this should be taken into account by urban planners and city centre environmental managers when considering climate change adaptation strategies or heatwave alert schemes. The methodology has been designed to be transparent and to make use of powerful and readily available datasets so that it can be easily replicated in other urban areas.},

abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) effect over Hangzhou, east China during a long-lasting heat wave was simulated by a weather research and forecasting (WRF) model coupled with an urban canopy model (UCM) at a horizontal resolution of 1. km. Based on satellite-measured nighttime light data and the normalized difference vegetation index, a human settlement index was used to represent the current urban land cover and define three urban land subcategories in the UCM. Three numerical simulations representing different urbanization scenarios and an idealized simulation with all the urban surface replaced with cropland were performed. Using up-to-date urban land use data, the coupled WRF/UCM model reasonably reproduced the majority of the observed spatial and temporal characteristics of the 2-m temperature field over the simulation period in Hangzhou. Strong UHI effects that can cause intensification and expansion of the areas experiencing extreme heat stress were observed in both actual measurements and simulations. In the simulation, an average temperature increase of 0.74. °C in the city center was observed under high urbanization conditions. The UHI peak reached a maximum value of 1.6. °C at 1900 LST around sunset. Analysis of the surface energy balance showed that the UHI is mainly caused by a greater heat storage in the urban fabric during the day and the release of this heat in the evening. Comparisons among the results of four sensitivity runs showed that urban land use, classification of three urban land subcategories, and consideration of anthropogenic heat release respectively contributed 56.8{\%} (0.42. °C), 13.5{\%} (0.10. °C), and 29.7{\%} (0.22. °C) to the simulated UHI effects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
